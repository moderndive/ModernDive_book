**(LC1.1)** Repeat the earlier installation steps … for `dplyr`, `nycflights23`, and `knitr`.

**Solution**: In RStudio → **Packages** tab → **Install** → enter `dplyr`, `nycflights23`, `knitr` → **Install**.
(Or run `install.packages(c("dplyr","nycflights23","knitr"))` in the Console.)

**(LC1.2)** "Load" the `dplyr`, `nycflights23`, and `knitr` packages as well by repeating the earlier steps.

**Solution**:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights23)
library(knitr)
```

**(LC1.3)** What does any ONE row in this `flights` dataset refer to?

**Solution**: **B. Data on a flight** (one departure) from a NYC airport in 2023.

**(LC1.4)** What are some other examples in this dataset of *categorical* variables? What makes them different than *quantitative* variables?

**Solution**: Hint: Type `?flights` in the console to see what all the variables mean!

* Categorical:
    + `carrier` the company
    + `dest` the destination
    + `flight` the flight number. Even though this is a number, its simply a label. Example United 1545 is not  less than United 1714
* Quantitative:
    + `distance` the distance in miles
    + `time_hour` time

**(LC1.5)** What do `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `tz`, `dst`, and `tzone` describe in `airports`? (Best guess.)

**Solution**:

* `lat` = latitude, `lon` = longitude
* `alt` = airport altitude (likely feet)
* `tz` = time zone offset from UTC (hours)
* `dst` = daylight savings time code/indicator
* `tzone` = time zone name (IANA string)

**(LC1.6)** Provide variables in a data frame where at least one is an ID variable and at least two are not.

**Solution**: In the `weather` data frame, the combination of `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`  are identification variables as they identify the observation in question.
* Anything else pertains to observations: `temp`, `humid`, `wind_speed`, etc.

**(LC1.7)** Look at the help file for `airports`. Revise your earlier guesses about `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `tz`, `dst`, `tzone` as needed.

**Solution**:

* `lat`, `lon`: **geographic latitude/longitude** of the airport
* `alt`: **altitude** (feet)
* `tz`: **hours offset from UTC** (e.g., −5 for Eastern Standard Time)
* `dst`: **daylight saving time** indicator (e.g., “A” = observes DST, etc., per help file coding)
* `tzone`: **IANA time zone name** (e.g., `"America/New_York"`)
