**(LC7.1)** Why is it important to mix the balls before a new sample?

**Solution:** To randomize selection and reduce dependence or bias between samples.

**(LC7.2)** Why didn’t all students get the same sample proportion?

**Solution:** Sampling variation. Different random samples from the same population yield different statistics.

**(LC7.3)** Why can’t we study sampling variation with only one virtual sample?

**Solution:** One sample shows only one outcome. Many samples are needed to observe variability and form a sampling distribution.

**(LC7.4)** Why didn’t we take 1000 samples of 50 balls by hand?

**Solution:** It is impractical and time consuming. Simulation is fast, scalable, and reproducible.

**(LC7.5)** From the 1000-sample histogram, is 30% red in $n = 50$ likely? What about 10%?

**Solution:** 30% is plausible though less common. 10% is very unlikely.

**(LC7.6)** As in Figure 7.12 comparing sample sizes, what about the center of the histograms?

**Solution:** **C.** The center of each histogram seems to be about the same, regardless of the sample size.

**(LC7.7)** As the sample size increases, the histogram gets narrower. What happens to the sample proportions?

**Solution:** **A.** They vary less.

**(LC7.8)** Why use random sampling when constructing sampling distributions?

**Solution:** **B.** To minimize bias and make inferences about the population.

**(LC7.9)** Why construct a histogram of sample means or proportions in a simulation study?

**Solution:** **A.** To visualize the distribution and assess normality or other patterns.

**(LC7.10)** In the bowl activity, what is the population parameter? Do we know its value? How can we know it exactly?

**Solution:** The population parameter is the true proportion of red balls, $p$. We can know it exactly by counting all balls and computing the proportion in the full population.

**(LC7.11)** How did we ensure the shovel samples were random?

**Solution:** By mixing the bowl between samples and sampling with replacement so each ball has equal chance on each draw.

**(LC7.12)** What is the expected value of the sample mean in the context of sampling distributions?

**Solution:** **B.** The population mean.

**(LC7.13)** What is the role of the Central Limit Theorem in inference?

**Solution:** **B.** It says the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normal as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population distribution.

**(LC7.14)** What does "sampling variation" refer to?

**Solution:** **B.** Differences in sample statistics due to random sampling.

**(LC7.15)** How does increasing the sample size affect the standard error of the sample mean?

**Solution:** **B.** It decreases the standard error.

**(LC7.16)** When does the sampling distribution of the sample mean approximate normal?

**Solution:**

* When the population is normal: yes, for any $n$.  
* When the sample size is very large: yes, by the CLT.  
* When the sample size is sufficiently large regardless of population: yes, by the CLT.  
* When the population is uniform: approximately normal if $n$ is large, but not necessarily for small $n$.  

**(LC7.17)** In comparing two samples, why do we add variances when finding the SE of a difference?

**Solution:** **B.** Adding variances reflects the total uncertainty contributed by both independent samples.

**(LC7.18)** For large samples, what is the shape of the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions?

**Solution:** **B.** Bell shaped, approximating a normal distribution.
