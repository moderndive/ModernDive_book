# Tidy data {#tidy}

In this chapter, we'll discuss the importance of tidy data.  You may think
that this means just having your data in a spreadsheet, but you'll see that
it is actually more specific than that.  Data actually comes to us in a variety
of formats from pictures to text and to just numbers.  We'll focus on datasets
that can be stored in a spreadsheet throughout this book as that is the most
common way data is collected in the sciences.

Having tidy data will allow us to more easily create data visualizations as we will see in Chapter \@ref(viz).  It will also help us with manipulating data in Chapter \@ref(manip) and in all subsequent chapters when we discuss statistical inference.  You may not necessarily understand the importance for **tidy data** but it will become more and more apparent as we proceed through the book.

```{r setup_tidy, include=FALSE}
chap <- 3
lc <- 0
rq <- 0
# **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`**
# **`r paste0("(RQ", chap, ".", (rq <- rq + 1), ")")`**
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width='\\textwidth')
```

## What is tidy data?

You have surely heard the word "tidy" in your life:

- "Tidy up your room!"
- "Please write your homework in a tidy way so that it is easier to grade and to provide feedback."
- Marie Kondo's best-selling book [_The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing_](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1469400636&sr=8-1&keywords=tidying+up)
- "I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - 'Read me, please!'" - Linda Grant

So what does it mean for your data to be **tidy**?  Put simply:  it means that your data is organized.  But it's more than just that.  It means that your data follows the same standard format making it easy for others to find elements of your data, to manipulate and transform your data, and for our purposes continuing with the common theme:  it makes it easier to visualize your data and the relationships between different variables in your data.

We will follow Hadley Wickham's definition of **tidy data** here [@tidy]:

> A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if
qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an
observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like
height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on
the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.

> Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is
messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations,
variables and types. In **tidy data**:

> 1. Each variable forms a column.
> 2. Each observation forms a row.
> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

```{r tidyfig, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tidy data graphic from http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-1.png")
```

Reading over this definition, you can begin to think about datasets that won't follow this nice format.

## The `nycflights13` datasets

We likely have all flown on airplanes or know someone that has. Air travel has become an ever-present aspect of our daily lives.  If you live in or are visiting a relatively large city and you walk around that city's airport, you see gates showing flight information from many different airlines.  And you will frequently see that some flights are delayed because of a variety of conditions.  Are there ways that we can avoid having to deal with these flight delays?  

We'd all like to arrive at our destinations on time whenever possible. (Unless you secretly love hanging out at airports.  If you are one of these people, pretend for the moment that you are very much anticipating being at your final destination.)  Hadley Wickham (herein just referred to as "Hadley") created multiple datasets containing information about departing flights from the New York City area in 2013 [@R-nycflights13].  We will begin by loading in one of these datasets, the `flights` dataset, and getting an idea of its structure:

```{r load_flights}
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
```

The `library` function here loads the R package `nycflights13` into the current R environment in which you are working.  (Note that you'll get an error if you try to load this package in and it hasn't been installed.  Check Chapter \@ref(intro) to make sure the package has been downloaded.)  The next line of code `data(flights)` loads in the `flights` dataset that is stored in the `nycflights13` package.  

This dataset and most others presented in this book will be in the `data.frame` format in R.  Dataframes are ways to look at collections of variables that are tightly coupled together.  Frequently, the best way to get a feel for a dataframe is to use the `View` function in RStudio.  This command will be given throughout the book as a reminder, but the actual output will be hidden.

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(flights)
```

```{block lc3-2, type='learncheck'}

<!--
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What does the `head` function give us?  Why might it be a useful function to run on a dataset you have been presented with?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What do you think the `tail` function would give us for the `flights` dataset?
-->

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What does any *ONE* row in this dataset refer to?

- A. Data on an airline 
- B. Data on a flight
- C. Data on an airport
- D. Data on multiple flights

***

By running `View(flights)`, we see the different **variables** listed in the columns and we see that there are different types of variables.  Some of the variables like `distance`, `day`, and `arr_delay` are what we will call **quantitative** variables.  These variables vary in a numerical way.  Other variables here are **categorical**.

Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the `View(flights)` output, you will see a column of numbers.  These are the row numbers of the dataset.  If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row correspond to.  In other words, this will allow you to identify what object is being referred to in a given row.  This is often called the **observational unit**.  The **observational unit** in this example is an individual flight departing New York City in 2013.

**Note**:  Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to 

- identify the observation unit, 
- specify the variables, and 
- give the types of variables you are presented with.

```{r}
str(flights)
```

***

```{block lc3-3, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What are some examples in this dataset of **categorical** variables?  What makes them different than **quantitative** variables?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What does `int`, `num`, and `chr` mean in the output above?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** How many different columns are in this dataset?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** How many different rows are in this dataset?

***

Another way to view the properties of a dataset is to use the `str` function ("str" is short for "structure").  This will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable.  In addition, the type of the variable is given immediately after the `:` following each variable's name.  Here, `int` and `num` refer to quantitative variables.  In contrast, `chr` refers to categorical variables.  One more type of variable is given here with the `time_hour` variable: **POSIXct**.  As you may suspect, this variable corresponds to a specific date and time of day.

Another nice feature of R is the help system.  You can get help in R by simply entering a question mark before the name of a function or an object and you will be presented with a page showing the documentation.  Note that this output help file is omitted here but can be accessed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf) on page 3 of the PDF document.

```{r eval=FALSE}
?flights
```

Another aspect of tidy data is a description of what each variable in the dataset represents.  This helps others to understand what your variable names mean and what they correspond to.  If we look at the output of `?flights`, we can see that a description of each variable by name is given.

An important feature to **ALWAYS** include with your data is the appropriate units of measurement.  We'll see this further when we work with the `dep_delay` variable in Chapter \@ref(viz).  (It's in minutes, but you'd get some really strange interpretations if you thought it was in hours or seconds.  UNITS MATTER!)

## How is `flights` tidy?

We see that `flights` has a rectangular shape with each row corresponding to a different flight and each column corresponding to a characteristic of that flight.  This matches exactly with how Hadley defined tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.

But what about the third property?

> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

We identified earlier that the observational unit in the `flights` dataset is an individual flight.  And we have shown that this dataset consists of `r format(nrow(flights), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE, trim = TRUE)` flights with `r ncol(flights)` variables.  In other words, some rows of this dataset don't refer to a measurement on an airline or on an airport.  They specifically refer to characteristics/measurements on a given **flight** from New York City in 2013.  

By contrast, also included in the `nycflights13` package are datasets with different observational units [@R-nycflights13]:

- `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
- `planes`: construction information about each plane
- `airports`: airport names and locations
- `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

You may have been asking yourself what `carrier` refers to in the `str(flights)` output above.  The `airlines` dataset provides a description of this with each airline being the observational unit:

```{r}
data(airlines)
airlines
```

As can be seen here when you just enter the name of an object in R, by default it will print the contents of that object to the screen.  Be careful!  It's usually better to use the `View()` function in RStudio since larger objects may take awhile to print to the screen and it likely won't be helpful to you to have hundreds of lines outputted.

## Normal forms of data

The datasets included in the `nycflights13` package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data.  We will see that there are ways to _merge_ (or _join_) the different tables together easily.  We are capable of doing so because each of the tables have _keys_ in common to relate one to another.  This is an important property of **normal forms** of data.  The process of decomposing dataframes into less redundant tables without losing information is called **normalization**.  More information is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).

We saw an example of this above with the `airlines` dataset.  While the `flights` dataframe could also include a column with the names of the airlines instead of the carrier code, this would be repetitive since there is a unique mapping of the carrier code to the name of the airline/carrier. 

Below an example is given showing how to **join** the `airlines` dataframe together with the `flights` dataframe by linking together the two datasets via a common **key** of `"carrier"`.  Note that this "joined" dataframe is assigned to a new dataframe called `joined_flights`. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
joined_flights <- inner_join(x = flights, y = airlines, by = "carrier")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(joined_flights)
```

If we `View` this dataset, we see a new variable has been created called (We will see in Subsection 5.1.1 ways to change `name` to a more descriptive variable name.)

More discussion about joining dataframes together will be given in Chapter \@ref(manip).  We will see there that the names of the columns to be linked need not match as they did here with `"carrier"`.

**`r paste0("(RQ", chap, ".", (rq <- rq + 1), ")")`** What are common characteristics of "tidy" datasets?

**`r paste0("(RQ", chap, ".", (rq <- rq + 1), ")")`** What makes "tidy" datasets useful for organizing data?

-->

**`r paste0("(RQ", chap, ".", (rq <- rq + 1), ")")`** How many variables are presented in the table below?  What does each row correspond to? (**Hint:** You may not be able to answer both of these questions immediately but take your best guess.)


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
students <- c(4, 6)
faculty <- c(2, 3)
kable(data_frame("students" = students, "faculty" = faculty))
```

**`r paste0("(RQ", chap, ".", (rq <- rq + 1), ")")`** The confusion you may have encountered in Question 4 is a common one those that work with data are commonly presented with.  This dataset is not tidy.  Actually, the dataset in Question 4 has three variables not the two that were presented.  Make a guess as to what these variables are and present a tidy dataset instead of this untidy one given in Question 4.

**`r paste0("(RQ", chap, ".", (rq <- rq + 1), ")")`** The actual data presented in Question 4 is given below in tidy data format:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
role <- c(rep("student", 10), rep("faculty", 5))
sociology <- c(rep(TRUE, 4), rep(FALSE, 6), rep(TRUE, 2), rep(FALSE, 3))
school_type <- c(rep("Public", 6), rep("Private", 4), rep("Public", 3), rep("Private", 2))
kable(data_frame("role" = role, `Sociology?` = sociology,
  `Type of School` = school_type))
```

- What does each row correspond to?  
- What are the different variables in this dataframe?  
- The `Sociology?` variable is known as a logical variable.  What types of values does a logical variable take on?

**`r paste0("(RQ", chap, ".", (rq <- rq + 1), ")")`** What are some advantages of data in normal forms?  What are some disadvantages?

## What's to come?

In Chapter \@ref(viz), we will further explore the distribution of a variable in a related dataset to `flights`:  the `temp` variable in the `weather` dataset.  We'll be interested in understanding how this variable varies in relation to the values of other variables in the dataset.  We will see that visualization is often a powerful tool in helping us see what is going on in a dataset.  It will be a useful way to expand on the `str` function we have seen here for tidy data.
