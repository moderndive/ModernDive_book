**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is the chief difference between a bootstrap distribution and a sampling distribution?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Looking at the bootstrap distribution for the sample mean in Figure \@ref(fig:one-thousand-sample-means), between what two values would you say *most* values lie?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What condition about the bootstrap distribution must be met for us to be able to construct confidence intervals using the standard error method?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Say we wanted to construct a 68% confidence interval instead of a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$. Describe what changes are needed to make this happen. Hint: we suggest you look at Appendix \@ref(appendix-normal-curve) on the normal distribution.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the *median* year of minting of *all* US pennies. Use the percentile method and, if appropriate, then use the standard-error method.

**Solution**:
