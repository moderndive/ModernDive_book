**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why is it important to mix the balls in the bowl before we take a new sample?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why is it that students did not all have the same sample proportion of red balls?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why couldn't we study the effects of sampling variation when we used the virtual shovel only once? Why did we need to take more than one virtual sample (in our case, 33 virtual samples)?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why did we not take 1000 samples of 50 balls by hand?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Looking at Figure \@ref(fig:samplingdistribution-virtual-1000), would you say that sampling 50 balls where 30% of them were red is likely or not? What about sampling 50 balls where 10% of them were red?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions) the histograms of sample proportions are somewhat bell-shaped. What can you say about the center of the histograms? - A. The smaller the sample size the more concentrated the center of the histogram. - B. The larger the sample size the smaller the center of the histogram. - C. The center of each histogram seems to be about the same, regardless of the sample size.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions) as the sample size increases, the histogram gets narrower. What happens with the sample proportions? - A. They vary less. - B. They vary by the same amount. - C. They vary more.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why do we use random sampling when constructing sampling distributions? - A. To always get the same sample - B. To minimize bias and make inferences about the population - C. To make the process easier - D. To reduce the number of samples needed

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why is it important to construct a histogram of sample means or proportions in a simulation study? - A. To visualize the distribution and assess normality or other patterns - B. To increase the accuracy of the sample means - C. To ensure all sample means are exactly the same - D. To remove any outliers from the data

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** In the case of our bowl activity, what is the *population parameter*? Do we know its value? How can we know its value exactly?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** How did we ensure that the samples collected with the shovel were random?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is the expected value of the sample mean in the context of sampling distributions? - A. The observed value of the sample mean - B. The population mean - C. The median of the sample distribution - D. The midpoint of the range

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is the role of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in statistical inference? - A. It provides the formula for calculating the standard deviation of any given sample, allowing for an understanding of the sample's spread or variability. - B. It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the population's distribution, as the sample size becomes large. - C. It determines the actual mean of the population directly by calculating it from a randomly selected sample, without needing additional data or assumptions. - D. It is a principle that applies strictly and exclusively to populations that are normally distributed, ensuring that only in such cases the sample means will follow a normal distribution pattern.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What does the term "sampling variation" refer to? - A. Variability in the population data. - B. Differences in sample statistics due to random sampling. - C. Changes in the population parameter over time. - D. Variation caused by errors in data collection.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** How does increasing the sample size affect the standard error of the sample mean? - A. It increases the standard error - B. It decreases the standard error - C. It has no effect on the standard error - D. It only affects the standard deviation

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** For each of the following cases, explain whether the sampling distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution. - When the population distribution is normal. - When the sample size is very large. - When the sample size is sufficiently large, regardless of the population distribution. - When the population distribution is uniform.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** In the context of comparing two samples, why do we add variances (squared standard deviations) instead of subtracting them when finding the standard error of the difference? - A. Because variances always cancel each other out - B. Because adding variances reflects the total uncertainty from both samples - C. Because subtracting variances always gives negative results - D. Because variances are not related to the standard error

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions expected to look like if both samples are large enough? - A. Uniform. - B. Bell-shaped, approximating a normal distribution. - C. Bimodal. - D. Skewed to the right.
