**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why do we use the sample mean to estimate the population mean in the almond activity? - A.

Because the sample mean requires less computational effort than the population mean. - D. Because the sample mean eliminates all sampling variation.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** How is the standard error of the sample mean weight of almonds calculated in the context of this example? - A. By dividing the sample mean by the population standard deviation. - B. By dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. - C.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What does a 95% confidence interval represent in the context of the almond weight estimation? - A. There is a 95% chance that the sample mean is within 1.96 standard deviations from the population mean. - B. The interval will contain 95% of the almond weights from the sample. - C. There is a 95% chance that the population mean falls within 1.96 standard errors from the sample mean. - D. The sample mean is exactly equal to the population mean 95% of the time.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why does the $t$ distribution have thicker tails compared to the standard normal distribution? - A. Because the sample mean is considered more likely to match the population mean closely. - B. Because the $t$ distribution is designed to work when the data does not follow a normal distribution. - C. Because it assumes that the sample size is always smaller when applying the $t$ distribution. - D. Because it accounts for the extra uncertainty that comes from using the sample standard deviation instead of the population standard deviation. \newpage

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is the effect of increasing the degrees of freedom on the $t$ distribution? - A. The tails of the distribution become thicker. - B. The tails of the distribution become thinner. - C. The distribution does not change with degrees of freedom. - D. The distribution becomes skewed to the right.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is the chief difference between a bootstrap distribution and a sampling distribution?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Looking at the bootstrap distribution for the sample mean in Figure \@ref(fig:one-thousand-sample-means), between what two values would you say *most* values lie?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Which of the following is true about the confidence level when constructing a confidence interval? - A. The confidence level determines the width of the interval and affects how likely it is to contain the population parameter. - B. The confidence level is always fixed at 95% for all statistical analyses involving confidence intervals. - C. A higher confidence level always results in a narrower confidence interval, making it more useful for practical purposes. - D. The confidence level is only relevant when the population standard deviation is known.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** How does increasing the sample size affect the width of a confidence interval for a given confidence level? - A. It increases the width of the confidence interval, making it less precise. - B. It has no effect on the width of the confidence interval since the confidence level is fixed. - C. It decreases the width of the confidence interval, making it more precise by reducing the margin of error. - D. It changes the confidence level directly, regardless of other factors.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the *median* weight of *all* almonds with the percentile method. Is it appropriate to also use the standard-error method?

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What are the advantages of using `infer` for building confidence intervals?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is the main purpose of bootstrapping in statistical inference? - A. To visualize data distributions and identify outliers. - B. To generate multiple samples from the original data for estimating parameters. - C. To replace missing data points with the mean of the dataset. - D.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What is a key difference between the percentile method and the standard error method for constructing confidence intervals using bootstrap samples? - A. The percentile method requires the population standard deviation. - B. The percentile method uses the middle 95% of bootstrap statistics, while the standard error method relies on the estimated standard error. - C. The standard error method always results in a narrower confidence interval. - D. The percentile method requires more bootstrap samples.
