**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Repeat the earlier installation steps, but for the `dplyr`, `nycflights23`, and `knitr` packages. This will install the earlier mentioned `dplyr` package for data wrangling, the `nycflights23` package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a New York City airport in 2023, and the `knitr` package for generating easy-to-read tables in R. We'll use these packages in the next section.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** "Load" the `dplyr`, `nycflights23`, and `knitr` packages as well by repeating the earlier steps.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What does any *ONE* row in this `flights` dataset refer to? - A. Data on an airline - B. Data on a flight - C. Data on an airport - D. Data on multiple flights

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What are some other examples in this dataset of *categorical* variables? What makes them different than *quantitative* variables?

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What properties of each airport do the variables `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `tz`, `dst`, and `tzone` describe in the `airports` data frame? Take your best guess.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables where one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Look at the help file for the `airports` data frame. Revise your earlier guesses about what the variables `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `tz`, `dst`, and `tzone` each describe.

**Solution**:
