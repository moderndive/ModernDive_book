**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Check that the LINE conditions are met for inference to be made in this Seattle house prices example with `price_interaction <- lm(log10_price ~ log10_size * condition, data = house_prices)`.

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Repeat the regression modeling in Subsection \@ref(house-prices-regression) and the prediction making you just did on the house of condition `r ex_condition` and size `r ex_size` square feet in Subsection \@ref(house-prices-making-predictions), but using the parallel slopes model you visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:house-price-parallel-slopes).

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Interpret the results of the other rows in terms of inference in the `get_regression_table(price_interaction)` output in Table \@ref(tab:seattle-interaction) that we did not interpret in Subsection \@ref(house-prices-inference-for-regression).

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Create, visualize, and interpret confidence intervals using both theory-based and simulation-based approaches to mirror the hypothesis testing done in Subsection \@ref(house-prices-inference-for-regression).

**Solution**:


**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What date between 1994 and 2003 has the fewest number of births in the US? What story could you tell about why this is the case?

**Solution**:
