## Contents of this Repository

ModernDive is built using RStudio's [`bookdown`](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-bookdown/) package; for more information on how to use `bookdown` see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/). If you'd like to build the book on your own, please make sure to first install the `bookdown` package via `install.packages("bookdown")`.

* The `bookdown` source code for the current version of the book is in the `master` branch of this repo. 
* The `bookdown` source code for all [previously released versions](https://moderndive.com/index.html#about-book) of ModernDive is accessible on the [Releases](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book/releases) page. A summary of all changes between versions can be found in [NEWS.md](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book/blob/master/NEWS.md).
* The contents of [moderndive.com](https://moderndive.com/) are deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) from the `release` branch of this repo.

We are also slowly working on a future version of ModernDive:

* The `bookdown` source code for the future version of the book is in the `v2` branch of this repo.
* A preview is available at [https://moderndive.netlify.app/](https://moderndive.netlify.app/).
