Process of making the pennies' pictures presented in the book: 

Initially, we gave each of them a randomized serial number from 1 to 50 as IDs, took photos of each of them and recorded their IDs and year of production.  

We also put the 50 pennies together in 5 rows of 10 each, ordered by ID numbers, and took a picture of them all, each labeled with their ID numbers and years of production, to get a picture of how the pennies were ordered, before the randomized re-sampleing:  https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book/blob/master/images/sampling/pennies/deliverable/3.jpg

Then, we used R to randomize the sample and got a randomized order of the 50 pennies. To visualize the virtual ramdom sample, we used Photoshop to combine the 50 pennies together, ordered by their new order from R demand, and then, again, labeled each penny with their ID numbers and years of production, to get a picture of how the pennies were ordered, after the randomized re-sampling: https://github.com/Starryz/moderndive_book/blob/master/images/sampling/pennies/deliverable/4.jpg
