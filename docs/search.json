Exploratory data analysis can give sense data, help identify issues data, bring light outliers, help inform model construction. Recall three common steps exploratory data analysis introduced Subsection 5.1.1:Looking raw data values.Computing summary statistics.Creating data visualizations.First, let’s look raw data using View() bring RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer glimpse() function dplyr package:questions can ask stage EDA: variables numerical? categorical? categorical variables, levels? Besides variables ’ll using regression model, variables think useful use model predicting house price?Observe, example, raw data condition variable values 1 5, saved R fct standing “factors.” Recall one R’s ways saving categorical variables. think “labels” 1 5 numerical values 1 5.Let’s now perform second step EDA: computing summary statistics. Recall Section 3.3 summary statistics single numerical values summarize large number values. Examples summary statistics include mean, median, standard deviation, various percentiles.Let’s use convenient tidy_summary() function moderndive package first used Subsection 6.1.1, sure select() variables interest model:\nTABLE 11.1: Summary house_prices variables.\nObserve mean price $540,088 larger median $450,000. small number expensive houses inflating average. words, “outlier” house prices dataset. (fact become even apparent create visualizations next.)However, median sensitive outlier house prices. news real estate market generally report median house prices mean/average house prices. say median robust outliers mean. Similarly, standard deviation interquartile-range (IQR) measures spread variability, IQR based quantiles Q3 - Q1 robust outliers.Let’s now perform last three common steps exploratory data analysis: creating data visualizations. Let’s first create univariate visualizations. plots focusing single variable time. Since price sqft_living numerical variables, can visualize distributions using geom_histogram() seen Section 2.5 histograms. hand, since condition categorical, can visualize distribution using geom_bar(). Recall Section 2.8 barplots since condition “pre-counted”, use geom_bar() geom_col().Figure 11.3, display three visualizations .\nFIGURE 11.3: Exploratory visualizations Seattle house prices data.\nFirst, observe bottom plot houses condition “3”, conditions “4” “5”, almost none “1” “2”.Next, see histogram price (top-left plot) majority houses less two million dollars. Observe also x-axis stretches 8 million dollars, even though appear houses close price. small number houses prices closer 8 million noted tidy_summary(). outlier house prices mentioned earlier. say variable price right-skewed exhibited long right tail., histogram sqft_living middle plot shows houses appear less 5000 square feet living space. comparison, American football field US 57,600 square feet, whereas standard soccer/association football field 64,000 square feet. Observe also variable also right-skewed, although drastically price variable.price sqft_living variables, right-skew makes distinguishing houses lower end x-axis hard. scale x-axis compressed small number quite expensive immensely-sized houses.can skew? Let’s apply log10 transformation variables.\nunfamiliar transformations, highly recommend read Appendix online logarithmic (log) transformations.\nsummary, log transformations allow us alter scale variable focus multiplicative changes instead additive changes. words, shift view relative changes instead absolute changes. multiplicative/relative changes also called changes orders magnitude.Let’s create new log10 transformed versions right-skewed variable price sqft_living using mutate() function Section 3.5, ’ll give latter name log10_size, shorter easier understand name log10_sqft_living.Let’s display effects transformation variables first 10 rows house_prices:Observe particular houses sixth third rows. house sixth row price $1,225,000, just one million dollars. Since \\(10^6\\) one million, log10_price around 6.09. Contrast houses log10_price less six, since price less $1,000,000. house third row house sqft_living less 1000.
