While a PDF version of this book can be found here, this is very much a work in progress with many things that still need to be fixed. We appreciate your patience. 1.1 Introduction for students This book assumes no prerequisites: no algebra, no calculus, and no prior programming/coding experience. This is intended to be a gentle introduction to the practice of analyzing data and answering questions using data the way data scientists, statisticians, data journalists, and other researchers would. In Figure 1.1 we present a flowchart of what you’ll cover in this book. You’ll first get started with data in Chapter 2, where you’ll learn about the difference between R and RStudio, start coding in R, understand what R packages are, and explore your first dataset: all domestic departure flights from a New York City airport in 2013. Then Data science: You’ll assemble your data science toolbox using tidyverse packages. In particular: Ch.3: Visualizing data via the ggplot2 package. Ch.5: Understanding the concept of “tidy” data as a standardized data input format for all packages in the tidyverse Ch.4: Wrangling data via the dplyr package. Data modeling: Using these data science tools and helper functions from the moderndive package, you’ll start performing data modeling. In particular: Ch.6: Constructing basic regression models. Ch.7: Constructing multiple regression models. Statistical inference: Once again using your newly acquired data science tools, we’ll unpack statistical inference using the infer package. In particular: Ch.8: Understanding the role that sampling variability plays in statistical inference using both tactile and virtual simulations of sampling from a “bowl” with an unknown proportion of red balls. Ch.9: Building confidence intervals. Ch.10: Conducting hypothesis tests. Data modeling revisited: Armed with your new understanding of statistical inference, you’ll revisit and review the models you constructed in Ch.6 &amp; Ch.7. In particular: Ch.11: Interpreting both the statistical and practice significance of the results of the models. We’ll end with a discussion on what it means to “think with data” in Chapter 12 and present an example case study data analysis of house prices in Seattle. FIGURE 1.1: ModernDive Flowchart 1.1.1 What you will learn from this book We hope that by the end of this book, you’ll have learned How to use R to explore data. How to answer statistical questions using tools like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. How to effectively create “data stories” using these tools. What do we mean by data stories? We mean any analysis involving data that engages the reader in answering questions with careful visuals and thoughtful discussion, such as How strong is the relationship between per capita income and crime in Chicago neighborhoods? and How many f**ks does Quentin Tarantino give (as measured by the amount of swearing in his films)?. Further discussions on data stories can be found in this Think With Google article. For other examples of data stories constructed by students like yourselves, look at the final projects for two courses that have previously used ModernDive: Middlebury College MATH 116 Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences using student collected data. Pacific University SOC 301 Social Statistics using data from the fivethirtyeight R package. This book will help you develop your “data science toolbox”, including tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression. With these tools, you’ll be able to perform the entirety of the “data/science pipeline” while building data communication skills (see Subsection 1.1.2 for more details). In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization. In today’s world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas. We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are to convey relationships with data. You’ll also see the use of visualization to introduce concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, distributions, etc. In general, we’ll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book. To impart the statistical lessons in this book, we have intentionally minimized the number of mathematical formulas used and instead have focused on developing a conceptual understanding via data visualization, statistical computing, and simulations. We hope this is a more intuitive experience than the way statistics has traditionally been taught in the past and how it is commonly perceived. Finally, you’ll learn the importance of literate programming. By this we mean you’ll learn how to write code that is useful not just for a computer to execute but also for readers to understand exactly what your analysis is doing and how you did it. This is part of a greater effort to encourage reproducible research (see Subsection 1.1.3 for more details). Hal Abelson coined the phrase that we will follow throughout this book: “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” We understand that there may be challenging moments as you learn to program. Both of us continue to struggle and find ourselves often using web searches to find answers and reach out to colleagues for help. In the long run though, we all can solve problems faster and more elegantly via programming. We wrote this book as our way to help you get started and you should know that there is a huge community of R users that are always happy to help everyone along as well. This community exists in particular on the internet on various forums and websites such as stackoverflow.com. 1.1.2 Data/science pipeline You may think of statistics as just being a bunch of numbers. We commonly hear the phrase “statistician” when listening to broadcasts of sporting events. Statistics (in particular, data analysis), in addition to describing numbers like with baseball batting averages, plays a vital role in all of the sciences. You’ll commonly hear the phrase “statistically significant” thrown around in the media. You’ll see articles that say “Science now shows that chocolate is good for you.” Underpinning these claims is data analysis. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to better understand whether these claims should be trusted or whether we should be wary. Inside data analysis are many sub-fields that we will discuss throughout this book (though not necessarily in this order): data collection data wrangling data visualization data modeling inference correlation and regression interpretation of results data communication/storytelling These sub-fields are summarized in what Grolemund and Wickham term the “Data/Science Pipeline” in Figure 1.2. FIGURE 1.2: Data/Science Pipeline We will begin by digging into the gray Understand portion of the cycle with data visualization, then with a discussion on what is meant by tidy data and data wrangling, and then conclude by talking about interpreting and discussing the results of our models via Communication. These steps are vital to any statistical analysis. But why should you care about statistics? “Why did they make me take this class?” There’s a reason so many fields require a statistics course. Scientific knowledge grows through an understanding of statistical significance and data analysis. You needn’t be intimidated by statistics. It’s not the beast that it used to be and, paired with computation, you’ll see how reproducible research in the sciences particularly increases scientific knowledge. 1.1.3 Reproducible research “The most important tool is the mindset, when starting, that the end product will be reproducible.” – Keith Baggerly Another goal of this book is to help readers understand the importance of reproducible analyses. The hope is to get readers into the habit of making their analyses reproducible from the very beginning. This means we’ll be trying to help you build new habits. This will take practice and be difficult at times. You’ll see just why it is so important for you to keep track of your code and well-document it to help yourself later and any potential collaborators as well. Copying and pasting results from one program into a word processor is not the way that efficient and effective scientific research is conducted. It’s much more important for time to be spent on data collection and data analysis and not on copying and pasting plots back and forth across a variety of programs. In a traditional analyses if an error was made with the original data, we’d need to step through the entire process again: recreate the plots and copy and paste all of the new plots and our statistical analysis into your document. This is error prone and a frustrating use of time. We’ll see how to use R Markdown to get away from this tedious activity so that we can spend more time doing science. “We are talking about computational reproducibility.” - Yihui Xie Reproducibility means a lot of things in terms of different scientific fields. Are experiments conducted in a way that another researcher could follow the steps and get similar results? In this book, we will focus on what is known as computational reproducibility. This refers to being able to pass all of one’s data analysis, data-sets, and conclusions to someone else and have them get exactly the same results on their machine. This allows for time to be spent interpreting results and considering assumptions instead of the more error prone way of starting from scratch or following a list of steps that may be different from machine to machine. 1.1.4 Final note for students At this point, if you are interested in instructor perspectives on this book, ways to contribute and collaborate, or the technical details of this book’s construction and publishing, then continue with the rest of the chapter below. Otherwise, let’s get started with R and RStudio in Chapter 2! 1.2 Introduction for instructors This book is inspired by the following books: “Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R” (Chihara and Hesterberg 2011), “OpenIntro: Intro Stat with Randomization and Simulation” (Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014), and “R for Data Science” (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). The first book, while designed for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, provides an excellent resource on how to use resampling to impart statistical concepts like sampling distributions using computation instead of large-sample approximations and other mathematical formulas. The last two books are free options to learning introductory statistics and data science, providing an alternative to the many traditionally expensive introductory statistics textbooks. When looking over the large number of introductory statistics textbooks that currently exist, we found that there wasn’t one that incorporated many newly developed R packages directly into the text, in particular the many packages included in the tidyverse collection of packages, such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and broom. Additionally, there wasn’t an open-source and easily reproducible textbook available that exposed new learners all of three of the learning goals listed at the outset of Subsection 1.1.1. 1.2.1 Who is this book for? This book is intended for instructors of traditional introductory statistics classes using RStudio, either the desktop or server version, who would like to inject more data science topics into their syllabus. We assume that students taking the class will have no prior algebra, calculus, nor programming/coding experience. Here are some principles and beliefs we kept in mind while writing this text. If you agree with them, this might be the book for you. Blur the lines between lecture and lab With increased availability and accessibility of laptops and open-source non-proprietary statistical software, the strict dichotomy between lab and lecture can be loosened. It’s much harder for students to understand the importance of using software if they only use it once a week or less. They forget the syntax in much the same way someone learning a foreign language forgets the rules. Frequent reinforcement is key. Focus on the entire data/science research pipeline We believe that the entirety of Grolemund and Wickham’s data/science pipeline should be taught. We believe in “minimizing prerequisites to research”: students should be answering questions with data as soon as possible. It’s all about the data We leverage R packages for rich, real, and realistic data-sets that at the same time are easy-to-load into R, such as the nycflights13 and fivethirtyeight packages. We believe that data visualization is a gateway drug for statistics and that the Grammar of Graphics as implemented in the ggplot2 package is the best way to impart such lessons. However, we often hear: “You can’t teach ggplot2 for data visualization in intro stats!” We, like David Robinson, are much more optimistic. dplyr has made data wrangling much more accessible to novices, and hence much more interesting data-sets can be explored. Use simulation/resampling to introduce statistical inference, not probability/mathematical formulas Instead of using formulas, large-sample approximations, and probability tables, we teach statistical concepts using resampling-based inference. This allows for a de-emphasis of traditional probability topics, freeing up room in the syllabus for other topics. Don’t fence off students from the computation pool, throw them in! Computing skills are essential to working with data in the 21st century. Given this fact, we feel that to shield students from computing is to ultimately do them a disservice. We are not teaching a course on coding/programming per se, but rather just enough of the computational and algorithmic thinking necessary for data analysis. Complete reproducibility and customizability We are frustrated when textbooks give examples, but not the source code and the data itself. We give you the source code for all examples as well as the whole book! Ultimately the best textbook is one you’ve written yourself. You know best your audience, their background, and their priorities. You know best your own style and the types of examples and problems you like best. Customization is the ultimate end.

["2-getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started with Data in R 2.1 What are R and RStudio? 2.2 How do I code in R? 2.3 What are R packages? 2.4 Explore your first datasets 2.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 2 Getting Started with Data in R Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first: What are R and RStudio? How do I code in R? What are R packages? We’ll introduce these concepts in upcoming Sections 2.1-2.3. If you are already somewhat familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to Section 2.4 where we’ll introduce our first data set: all domestic flights departing a New York City airport in 2013. This is a dataset we will explore in depth in this book. 2.1 What are R and RStudio? For much of this book, we will assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest: R is like a car’s engine. RStudio is like a car’s dashboard. R: Engine RStudio: Dashboard More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well. 2.1.1 Installing R and RStudio Note about RStudio Server: If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server, then you can skip this section. We do recommend though after a few months of working on the RStudio Server that you return to these instructions. You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. You must do this first: Download and install R. Click on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system. You must do this second: Download and install RStudio. Scroll down to “Installers for Supported Platforms” Click on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system. 2.1.2 Using R via RStudio Recall our car analogy from above. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs AKA applications you can open. We will always work in RStudio and not R. In other words: R: Do not open this RStudio: Open this After you open RStudio, you should see the following: Note the three panes, which are three panels dividing the screen: The Console pane, the Files pane, and the Environment pane. Over the course of this chapter, you’ll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serve. 2.2 How do I code in R? Now that you’re set up with R and RStudio, you are probably asking yourself “OK. Now how do I use R?” The first thing to note as that unlike other statistical software programs like Excel, STATA, or SAS that provide point and click interfaces, R is an interpreted language, meaning you have to enter in R commands written in R code. In other words, you have to code/program in R. Note that we’ll use the terms “coding” and “programming” interchangeably in this book. While it is not required to be a seasoned coder/computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that R users need to understand. Consequently, while this book is not a book on programming, you will still learn just enough of these basic programming concepts needed to explore and analyze data effectively. 2.2.1 Basic programming concepts and terminology We now introduce some basic programming concepts and terminology that you’ll learn as you go. Note that in this book, we will use a different font to distinguish regular font from computer_code. It is important to note that while these tutorials serve as excellent introductions, a single pass through them is insufficient for long-term learning and retention. The ultimate tools for long-term learning and retention are “learning by doing” and repetition, something we will have you do over the course of the entire book and we encourage this process as much as possible as you learn any new skill. Basics: Console pane: where you enter in commands Objects: where values are saved, how to assign values to objects. Data types: integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, characters. Vectors: a series of values. These are created using the c() function where c() stands for “combine” or “concatenate”. For example: c(6, 11, 13, 31, 90, 92). Factors: Categorical data (as opposed to numerical data) are represented in R as factors. Data frames: They are analogous to rectangular spreadsheets: they are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations. We will revisit this later in Section 2.4. Conditionals: Testing for equality in R using == (and not = which is typically used for assignment). Ex: 2 + 1 == 3 compares 2 + 1 to 3 and is correct R syntax, while 2 + 1 = 3 is not and is incorrect R syntax. Boolean algebra: TRUE/FALSE statements and mathematical operators such as &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), and != (not equal to). Logical operators: &amp; representing “and”, | representing “or”. Ex: (2 + 1 == 3) &amp; (2 + 1 == 4) returns FALSE while (2 + 1 == 3) | (2 + 1 == 4) returns TRUE. Functions Concept of functions: they take in inputs (called arguments) and return outputs. You either manually specify a function’s arguments or use the function’s defaults. This list is by no means an exhaustive list of all the programming concepts and terminology needed to become a savvy R user; such a list would be so large it wouldn’t be very useful, especially for novices. Rather, we feel this is the bare minimum you need to know before you get started; the rest we feel you can learn as you go. Remember that your knowledge of all of these concepts will build as you get better and better at “speaking R” and getting used to its syntax. 2.2.2 Errors, warnings, and messages One slightly confusing part of R is how it reports errors, warnings, and messages. The default theme in RStudio colors errors, warnings, and messages in red, which makes them seem like you did something wrong. However, seeing red text in the console is not always bad. R will show red text in the console in three different situations: Errors: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. For example, as shown in Subsection 2.3.3 below if you see Error in ggplot(...) : could not find function &quot;ggplot&quot;, it means that the ggplot() function is not accessible because the package was not loaded with library(ggplot2), and thus you cannot use it. Warnings: When the red text is a warning, it will be prefaced with “Warning:” and try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. For example, you see in Chapter 3 if you plot a scatterplot and one of the rows in your data frame is missing a value, you will see this warning: Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point). R will still make the scatterplot with all the remaining values, but it’s warning you that one of the points isn’t there. Messages: When the red text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning”, it’s just a friendly message. You’ll see these messages when you load some packages like the dplyr package in Subsection 2.3.2 below, or when you read data saved in spreadsheet files with read_csv() as you’ll see in Chapter 5. These are helpful diagnostic messages and they don’t stop your code from working. Remember, when you see red text in the console, don’t panic. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. If the text starts with “Error”, figure out what’s causing it. Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong! If the text starts with “Warning”, figure out if it’s something to worry about. For instance, if you get a warning about missing values in a scatterplot and you know there are missing values, you’re fine. If that’s surprising, look at your data and see what’s missing. Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working fine, but watch out/pay attention. Otherwise the text is just a message. Read it, wave back at R, and thank it for talking to you. Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine. 2.2.3 Tips on learning to code Learning to code/program is very much like learning a foreign language, it can be very daunting and frustrating at first. Such frustrations are very common and it is very normal to feel discouraged as you learn. However just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn. Here are a few useful tips to keep in mind as you learn to program: Remember that computers are not actually that smart: You may think your computer or smartphone are “smart,” but really people spent a lot of time and energy designing them to appear “smart.” Rather you have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore the instructions you give your computer can’t have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way. Take the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach: Especially when learning your first programming language, it is often much easier to taking existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends, rather than trying to write new code from scratch. We call this the copy, paste, and tweak approach. So early on, we suggest not trying to write code from memory, but rather take existing examples we have provided you, then copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. Don’t be afraid to play around! The best way to learn to code is by doing: Rather than learning to code for its own sake, we feel that learning to code goes much smoother when you have a goal in mind or when you are working on a particular project, like analyzing data that you are interested in. Practice is key: Just as the only method to improving your foreign language skills is through practice, practice, and practice; so also the only method to improving your coding is through practice, practice, and practice. Don’t worry however; we’ll give you plenty of opportunities to do so! 2.3 What are R packages? Another point of confusion with many new R users is the idea of an R package. R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a world-wide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet. For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are: The ggplot2 package for data visualization in Chapter 3. The dplyr package for data wrangling in Chapter 4. The moderndive package that accompanies this book. The infer package for “tidy” and transparent statistical inference in Chapters 9, 10, and 11. A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone: R: A new phone R Packages: Apps you can download So R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play. Let’s continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a recent photo you have taken on Instagram. You need to: Install the app: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you’re set. You might do this again in the future any time there is an update to the app. Open the app: After you’ve installed Instagram, you need to open the app. Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to: Install the package: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you’ve installed a package, you likely won’t install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version. “Load” the package: “Loading” a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not “loaded” by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to “load” each package you want to use every time you start RStudio. Let’s now show you how to perform these two steps for the ggplot2 package for data visualization. 2.3.1 Package installation Note about RStudio Server: If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server, you probably will not need to install packages, as they have likely been pre-installed for you by your instructor. That being said, it is still a good idea to know this process for later on when you are not using RStudio Server, but rather RStudio Desktop on your own computer. There are two ways to install an R package. For example, to install the ggplot2 package: Easy way: In the Files pane of RStudio: Click on the “Packages” tab Click on “Install” Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type ggplot2 Click “Install” Slightly harder way: An alternative but slightly less convenient way to install a package is by typing install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) in the Console pane of RStudio and hitting enter. Note you must include the quotation marks. Much like an app on your phone, you only have to install a package once. However, if you want to update an already installed package to a newer version, you need to re-install it by repeating the above steps. Learning check (LC2.1) Repeat the above installing steps, but for the dplyr, nycflights13, and knitr packages. This will install the earlier mentioned dplyr package, the nycflights13 package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a NYC airport in 2013, and the knitr package for writing reports in R. 2.3.2 Package loading Recall that after you’ve installed a package, you need to “load” it, in other words open it. We do this by using the library() command. For example, to load the ggplot2 package, run the following code in the Console pane. What do we mean by “run the following code”? Either type or copy &amp; paste the following code into the Console pane and then hit the enter key. library(ggplot2) If after running the above code, a blinking cursor returns next to the &gt; “prompt” sign, it means you were successful and the ggplot2 package is now loaded and ready to use. If however, you get a red “error message” that reads… Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’ … it means that you didn’t successfully install it. In that case, go back to the previous subsection “Package installation” and install it. Learning check (LC2.2) “Load” the dplyr, nycflights13, and knitr packages as well by repeating the above steps. 2.3.3 Package use One extremely common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is they forget to “load” them first by using the library() command we just saw. Remember: you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio. If you don’t first “load” a package, but attempt to use one of its features, you’ll see an error message similar to: Error: could not find function R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been “loaded.” Almost all new users forget do this when starting out, and it is a little annoying to get used. However, you’ll remember with practice. 2.4 Explore your first datasets Let’s put everything we’ve learned so far into practice and start exploring some real data! Data comes to us in a variety of formats, from pictures to text to numbers. Throughout this book, we’ll focus on datasets that are saved in “spreadsheet”-type format; this is probably the most common way data are collected and saved in many fields. Remember from Subsection 2.2.1 that these “spreadsheet”-type datasets are called data frames in R; we will focus on working with data saved as data frames throughout this book. Let’s first load all the packages needed for this chapter, assuming you’ve already installed them. Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages if you haven’t already. library(nycflights13) library(dplyr) library(knitr) At the beginning of all subsequent chapters in this text, we’ll always have a list of packages that you should have installed and loaded to work with that chapter’s R code. 2.4.1 nycflights13 package Many of us have flown on airplanes or know someone who has. Air travel has become an ever-present aspect in many people’s lives. If you live in or are visiting a relatively large city and you walk around that city’s airport, you see gates showing flight information from many different airlines. And you will frequently see that some flights are delayed because of a variety of conditions. Are there ways that we can avoid having to deal with these flight delays? We’d all like to arrive at our destinations on time whenever possible. (Unless you secretly love hanging out at airports. If you are one of these people, pretend for the moment that you are very much anticipating being at your final destination.) Throughout this book, we’re going to analyze data related to flights contained in the nycflights13 package (Wickham 2018). Specifically, this package contains five data sets saved in five separate data frames with information about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013. These include Newark Liberty International (EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), and LaGuardia (LGA) airports: flights: Information on all 336,776 flights airlines: A table matching airline names and their two letter IATA airline codes (also known as carrier codes) for 16 airline companies planes: Information about each of 3,322 physical aircraft used. weather: Hourly meteorological data for each of the three NYC airports. This data frame has 26,115 rows, roughly corresponding to the 365 \\(\\times\\) 24 \\(\\times\\) 3 = 26,280 possible hourly measurements one can observe at three locations over the course of a year. airports: Airport names, codes, and locations for 1,458 destination airports. 2.4.2 flights data frame We will begin by exploring the flights data frame that is included in the nycflights13 package and getting an idea of its structure. Run the following code in your console (either by typing it or cutting &amp; pasting it): it loads in the flights dataset into your Console. Note depending on the size of your monitor, the output may vary slightly. flights # A tibble: 336,776 x 19 year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 2013 1 1 517 515 2 830 819 2 2013 1 1 533 529 4 850 830 3 2013 1 1 542 540 2 923 850 4 2013 1 1 544 545 -1 1004 1022 5 2013 1 1 554 600 -6 812 837 6 2013 1 1 554 558 -4 740 728 7 2013 1 1 555 600 -5 913 854 8 2013 1 1 557 600 -3 709 723 9 2013 1 1 557 600 -3 838 846 10 2013 1 1 558 600 -2 753 745 # … with 336,766 more rows, and 11 more variables: arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, # carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;, tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, # air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;, hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; Let’s unpack this output: A tibble: 336,776 x 19: A tibble is a kind of data frame used in R. This particular data frame has 336,776 rows 19 columns corresponding to 19 variables describing each observation year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time are different columns, in other words variables, of this data frame. We then have the first 10 rows of observations corresponding to 10 flights. ... with 336,766 more rows, and 11 more variables: indicating to us that 336,766 more rows of data and 11 more variables could not fit in this screen. Unfortunately, this output does not allow us to explore the data very well. Let’s look at different tools to explore data frames. 2.4.3 Exploring data frames Among the many ways of getting a feel for the data contained in a data frame such as flights, we present three functions that take as their “argument”, in other words their input, the data frame in question. We also include a fourth method for exploring one particular column of a data frame: Using the View() function built for use in RStudio. We will use this the most. Using the glimpse() function, which is included in the dplyr package. Using the kable() function, which is included in the knitr package. Using the $ operator to view a single variable in a data frame. 1. View(): Run View(flights) in your Console in RStudio, either by typing it or cutting &amp; pasting it into the Console pane, and explore this data frame in the resulting pop-up viewer. You should get into the habit of always Viewing any data frames that come your way. Note the capital “V” in View. R is case-sensitive so you’ll receive an error is you run view(flights) instead of View(flights). Learning check (LC2.3) What does any ONE row in this flights dataset refer to? A. Data on an airline B. Data on a flight C. Data on an airport D. Data on multiple flights By running View(flights), we see the different variables listed in the columns and we see that there are different types of variables. Some of the variables like distance, day, and arr_delay are what we will call quantitative variables. These variables are numerical in nature. Other variables here are categorical. Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the View(flights) output, you will see a column of numbers. These are the row numbers of the dataset. If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row corresponds to. In other words, this will allow you to identify what object is being referred to in a given row. This is often called the observational unit. The observational unit in this example is an individual flight departing New York City in 2013. You can identify the observational unit by determining what “thing” is being measured or described by each of the variables. We’ll talk more about observational units in Section 2.4.4 on identification and measurement variables below. 2. glimpse(): The second way to explore a data frame is using the glimpse() function included in the dplyr package. Thus, you can only use the glimpse() function after you’ve loaded the dplyr package. This function provides us with an alternative method for exploring a data frame than the View() function: glimpse(flights) Observations: 336,776 Variables: 19 $ year &lt;int&gt; 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, … $ month &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, … $ day &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, … $ dep_time &lt;int&gt; 517, 533, 542, 544, 554, 554, 555, 557, 557, 558, 558,… $ sched_dep_time &lt;int&gt; 515, 529, 540, 545, 600, 558, 600, 600, 600, 600, 600,… $ dep_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 4, 2, -1, -6, -4, -5, -3, -3, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -… $ arr_time &lt;int&gt; 830, 850, 923, 1004, 812, 740, 913, 709, 838, 753, 849… $ sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt; 819, 830, 850, 1022, 837, 728, 854, 723, 846, 745, 851… $ arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 20, 33, -18, -25, 12, 19, -14, -8, 8, -2, -3, 7, -… $ carrier &lt;chr&gt; &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;DL&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;EV&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, … $ flight &lt;int&gt; 1545, 1714, 1141, 725, 461, 1696, 507, 5708, 79, 301, … $ tailnum &lt;chr&gt; &quot;N14228&quot;, &quot;N24211&quot;, &quot;N619AA&quot;, &quot;N804JB&quot;, &quot;N668DN&quot;, &quot;N39… $ origin &lt;chr&gt; &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;LGA&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;LGA&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;LGA&quot;… $ dest &lt;chr&gt; &quot;IAH&quot;, &quot;IAH&quot;, &quot;MIA&quot;, &quot;BQN&quot;, &quot;ATL&quot;, &quot;ORD&quot;, &quot;FLL&quot;, &quot;IAD&quot;… $ air_time &lt;dbl&gt; 227, 227, 160, 183, 116, 150, 158, 53, 140, 138, 149, … $ distance &lt;dbl&gt; 1400, 1416, 1089, 1576, 762, 719, 1065, 229, 944, 733,… $ hour &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, … $ minute &lt;dbl&gt; 15, 29, 40, 45, 0, 58, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 59, … $ time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; 2013-01-01 05:00:00, 2013-01-01 05:00:00, 2013-01-01 … We see that glimpse() will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable. In addition, the data type (see Subsection 2.2.1) of the variable is given immediately after each variable’s name inside &lt; &gt;. Here, int and dbl refer to “integer” and “double”, which are computer coding terminology for quantitative/numerical variables. In contrast, chr refers to “character”, which is computer terminology for text data. Text data, such as the carrier or origin of a flight, are categorical variables. The time_hour variable is an example of one more type of data type: dttm. As you may suspect, this variable corresponds to a specific date and time of day. However, we won’t work with dates in this class and leave it to a more advanced book on data science. Learning check (LC2.4) What are some examples in this dataset of categorical variables? What makes them different than quantitative variables? 3. kable(): The final way to explore the entirety of a data frame is using the kable() function from the knitr package. Let’s explore the different carrier codes for all the airlines in our dataset two ways. Run both of these lines of code in your Console: airlines kable(airlines) At first glance, it may not appear that there is much difference in the outputs. However when using tools for document production such as R Markdown, the latter code produces output that is much more legible and reader-friendly. 4. $ operator Lastly, the $ operator allows us to explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console airlines airlines$name We used the $ operator to extract only the name variable and return it as a vector of length 16. We will only be occasionally exploring data frames using this operator, instead favoring the View() and glimpse() functions. 2.4.4 Identification &amp; measurement variables There is a subtle difference between the kinds of variables that you will encounter in data frames: identification variables and measurement variables. For example, let’s explore the airports data frame by showing the output of glimpse(airports) below: glimpse(airports) Observations: 1,458 Variables: 8 $ faa &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04G&quot;, &quot;06A&quot;, &quot;06C&quot;, &quot;06N&quot;, &quot;09J&quot;, &quot;0A9&quot;, &quot;0G6&quot;, &quot;0G7&quot;, &quot;0P2&quot;, … $ name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Lansdowne Airport&quot;, &quot;Moton Field Municipal Airport&quot;, &quot;Schaumbu… $ lat &lt;dbl&gt; 41.1, 32.5, 42.0, 41.4, 31.1, 36.4, 41.5, 42.9, 39.8, 48.1, 39.… $ lon &lt;dbl&gt; -80.6, -85.7, -88.1, -74.4, -81.4, -82.2, -84.5, -76.8, -76.6, … $ alt &lt;int&gt; 1044, 264, 801, 523, 11, 1593, 730, 492, 1000, 108, 409, 875, 1… $ tz &lt;dbl&gt; -5, -6, -6, -5, -5, -5, -5, -5, -5, -8, -5, -6, -5, -5, -5, -5,… $ dst &lt;chr&gt; &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;A&quot;… $ tzone &lt;chr&gt; &quot;America/New_York&quot;, &quot;America/Chicago&quot;, &quot;America/Chicago&quot;, &quot;Amer… The variables faa and name are what we will call identification variables: variables that uniquely identify each observational unit. They are mainly used to provide a unique name to each observational unit i.e. row, thereby allowing us to uniquely identify them. faa gives the unique code provided by the FAA for that airport, while the name variable gives the longer more natural name of the airport. The remaining variables (lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, tzone) are often called measurement or characteristic variables: variables that describe properties of each observational unit, in other words each observation in each row. For example, lat and long describe the latitude and longitude of each airport. Furthermore, sometimes a single variable might not be enough to uniquely identify each observational unit: combinations of variables might be needed. While it is not an absolute rule, for organizational purposes it is considered good practice to have your identification variables in the left-most columns of your data frame. Learning check (LC2.5) What properties of the observational unit do each of lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, and tzone describe for the airports data frame? Note that you may want to use ?airports to get more information. (LC2.6) Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables in which one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not. In other words, create your own tidy data frame that matches these conditions. 2.4.5 Help files Another nice feature of R is the help system. You can get help in R by entering a ? before the name of a function or data frame in question and you will be presented with a page showing the documentation. For example, let’s look at the help file for the flights data frame: ?flights A help file should pop-up in the Help pane of RStudio. If you have questions about a function or data frame included in an R package, you should get in the habit of consulting the help file right away. 2.5 Conclusion We’ve given you what we feel are the most essential concepts to know before you can start exploring data in R. Is this chapter exhaustive? Absolutely not. To try to include everything in this chapter would make the chapter so large it wouldn’t be useful! 2.5.1 Additional resources If you are completely new to the world of coding, R, and RStudio and feel you could benefit from a more detailed introduction, we suggest you check out ModernDive co-author Chester Ismay’s Getting used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown short book (Ismay 2016), which includes screencast recordings that you can follow along and pause as you learn. Furthermore, there is an introduction to R Markdown, a tool used for reproducible research in R. 2.5.2 What’s to come? As we stated earlier however, the best way to learn R is to learn by doing. We now start the “data science” portion of the book in Chapter 3 with what we feel is the most important tool in a data scientist’s toolbox: data visualization. We will continue to explore the data included in the nycflights13 package through data visualization. We’ll see that data visualization is a powerful tool to add to our toolbox for data exploring that provides additional insight to what the View() and glimpse() functions can provide.

By visualizing our data, we gain valuable insights that we couldn’t initially see from just looking at the raw data in spreadsheet form. We will use the ggplot2 package as it provides an easy way to customize your plots. ggplot2 is rooted in the data visualization theory known as The Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005). At the most basic level, graphics/plots/charts (we use these terms interchangeably in this book) provide a nice way for us to get a sense for how quantitative variables compare in terms of their center (where the values tend to be located) and their spread (how they vary around the center). Graphics should be designed to emphasize the findings and insight you want your audience to understand. This does however require a balancing act. On the one hand, you want to highlight as many meaningful relationships and interesting findings as possible; on the other you don’t want to include so many as to overwhelm your audience. As we will see, plots/graphics also help us to identify patterns and outliers in our data. We will see that a common extension of these ideas is to compare the distribution of one quantitative variable (i.e., what the spread of a variable looks like or how the variable is distributed in terms of its values) as we go across the levels of a different categorical variable. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(nycflights13) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) 3.1 The Grammar of Graphics We begin with a discussion of a theoretical framework for data visualization known as “The Grammar of Graphics,” which serves as the foundation for the ggplot2 package. Think of how we construct sentences in English to form sentences by combining different elements, like nouns, verbs, particles, subjects, objects, etc. However, we can’t just combine these elements in any arbitrary order; we must do so following a set of rules known as a linguistic grammar. Similarly to a linguistic grammar, “The Grammar of Graphics” define a set of rules for constructing statistical graphics by combining different types of layers. This grammar was created by Leland Wilkinson (Wilkinson 2005) and has been implemented in a variety of data visualization software including R. 3.1.1 Components of the Grammar In short, the grammar tells us that: A statistical graphic is a mapping of data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects. Specifically, we can break a graphic into the following three essential components: data: the data set composed of variables that we map. geom: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars. aes: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Each assigned aesthetic attribute can be mapped to a variable in our data set. You might be wondering why we wrote the terms data, geom, and aes in a computer code type font. We’ll see very shortly that we’ll specify the elements of the grammar in R using these terms. However, let’s first break down the grammar with an example. 3.1.2 Gapminder data In February 2006, a statistician named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled “The best stats you’ve ever seen” where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website gapminder.org. For example, for the 142 countries included from 2007, let’s consider only the first 6 countries when listed alphabetically in Table 3.1. TABLE 3.1: Gapminder 2007 Data: First 6 of 142 countries Country Continent Life Expectancy Population GDP per Capita Afghanistan Asia 43.8 31889923 975 Albania Europe 76.4 3600523 5937 Algeria Africa 72.3 33333216 6223 Angola Africa 42.7 12420476 4797 Argentina Americas 75.3 40301927 12779 Australia Oceania 81.2 20434176 34435 Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns: Country: Name of country. Continent: Which of the five continents the country is part of. (Note that “Americas” includes countries in both North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded.) Life Expectancy: Life expectancy in years. Population: Number of people living in the country. GDP per Capita: Gross domestic product (in US dollars). Now consider Figure 3.1, which plots this data for all 142 countries in the data. FIGURE 3.1: Life Expectancy over GDP per Capita in 2007 Let’s view this plot through the grammar of graphics: The data variable GDP per Capita gets mapped to the x-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Life Expectancy gets mapped to the y-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Population gets mapped to the size aesthetic of the points. The data variable Continent gets mapped to the color aesthetic of the points. We’ll see shortly that data corresponds to the particular data frame where our data is saved and a “data variable” corresponds to a particular column in the data frame. Furthermore, the type of geometric object considered in this plot are points. That being said, while in this example we are considering points, graphics are not limited to just points. Other plots involve lines while others involve bars. Let’s summarize the three essential components of the Grammar in Table 3.2. TABLE 3.2: Summary of Grammar of Graphics for this plot data variable aes geom GDP per Capita x point Life Expectancy y point Population size point Continent color point 3.1.3 Other components There are other components of the Grammar of Graphics we can control as well. As you start to delve deeper into the Grammar of Graphics, you’ll start to encounter these topics more frequently. In this book however, we’ll keep things simple and only work with the two additional components listed below: faceting breaks up a plot into small multiples corresponding to the levels of another variable (Section 3.6) position adjustments for barplots (Section 3.8) Other more complex components like scales and coordinate systems are left for a more advanced text such as R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). Generally speaking, the Grammar of Graphics allows for a high degree of customization of plots and also a consistent framework for easily updating and modifying them. 3.1.4 ggplot2 package In this book, we will be using the ggplot2 package for data visualization, which is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics for R (Wickham et al. 2019). As we noted earlier, a lot of the previous section was written in a computer code type font. This is because the various components of the Grammar of Graphics are specified in the ggplot() function included in the ggplot2 package, which expects at a minimum as arguments (i.e. inputs): The data frame where the variables exist: the data argument. The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the mapping argument which specifies the aesthetic attributes involved. After we’ve specified these components, we then add layers to the plot using the + sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the layer that specifies which type of geometric object we want the plot to involve: points, lines, bars, and others. Other layers we can add to a plot include layers specifying the plot title, axes labels, visual themes for the plots, and facets (which we’ll see in Section 3.6). Let’s now put the theory of the Grammar of Graphics into practice. 3.2 Five Named Graphs - The 5NG In order to keep things simple, we will only five different types of graphics in this book, each with a commonly given name. We term these “five named graphs” the 5NG: scatterplots linegraphs boxplots histograms barplots We will discuss some variations of these plots, but with this basic repertoire of graphics in your toolbox you can visualize a wide array of different variable types. Note that certain plots are only appropriate for categorical variables and while others are only appropriate for quantitative variables. You’ll want to quiz yourself often as we go along on which plot makes sense a given a particular problem or data set. 3.3 5NG#1: Scatterplots The simplest of the 5NG are scatterplots, also called bivariate plots. They allow you to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. While you may already be familiar with scatterplots, let’s view them through the lens of the Grammar of Graphics. Specifically, we will visualize the relationship between the following two numerical variables in the flights data frame included in the nycflights13 package: dep_delay: departure delay on the horizontal “x” axis and arr_delay: arrival delay on the vertical “y” axis for Alaska Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2013. This requires paring down the data from all 336,776 flights that left NYC in 2013, to only the 714 Alaska Airlines flights that left NYC in 2013. What this means computationally is: we’ll take the flights data frame, extract only the 714 rows corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights, and save this in a new data frame called alaska_flights. Run the code below to do this: alaska_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;) For now we suggest you ignore how this code works; we’ll explain this in detail in Chapter 4 when we cover data wrangling. However, convince yourself that this code does what it is supposed to by running View(alaska_flights): it creates a new data frame alaska_flights consisting of only the 714 Alaska Airlines flights. We’ll see later in Chapter 4 on data wrangling that this code uses the dplyr package for data wrangling to achieve our goal: it takes the flights data frame and filters it to only return the rows where carrier is equal to &quot;AS&quot;, Alaska Airlines’ carrier code. Other examples of carrier codes include “AA” for American Airlines and “UA” for United Airlines. Recall from Section 2.2 that testing for equality is specified with == and not =. Fasten your seat belts and sit tight for now however, we’ll introduce these ideas more fully in Chapter 4. Learning check (LC3.1) Take a look at both the flights and alaska_flights data frames by running View(flights) and View(alaska_flights). In what respect do these data frames differ? 3.3.1 Scatterplots via geom_point Let’s now go over the code that will create the desired scatterplot, keeping in mind our discussion on the Grammar of Graphics in Section 3.1. We’ll be using the ggplot() function included in the ggplot2 package. ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point() Let’s break this down piece-by-piece: Within the ggplot() function, we specify two of the components of the Grammar of Graphics as arguments (i.e. inputs): The data frame to be alaska_flights by setting data = alaska_flights. The aesthetic mapping by setting aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay). Specifically: the variable dep_delay maps to the x position aesthetic the variable arr_delay maps to the y position aesthetic We add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object. In this case the geometric object are points, set by specifying geom_point(). After running the above code, you’ll notice two outputs: a warning message and the graphic shown in Figure 3.2. Let’s first unpack the warning message: Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point). FIGURE 3.2: Arrival Delays vs Departure Delays for Alaska Airlines flights from NYC in 2013 After running the above code, R returns a warning message alerting us to the fact that 5 rows were ignored due to them being missing. For 5 rows either the value for dep_delay or arr_delay or both were missing (recorded in R as NA), and thus these rows were ignored in our plot. Turning our attention to the resulting scatterplot in Figure 3.2, we see that a positive relationship exists between dep_delay and arr_delay: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase. We also note the large mass of points clustered near (0, 0). Before we continue, let’s consider a few more notes on the layers in the above code that generated the scatterplot: Note that the + sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning. You’ll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning. When adding layers to a plot, you are encouraged to start a new line after the + so that the code for each layer is on a new line. As we add more and more layers to plots, you’ll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code. To stress the importance of adding layers in particular the layer specifying the geometric object, consider Figure 3.3 where no layers are added. A not very useful plot! ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) FIGURE 3.3: Plot with No Layers Learning check (LC3.2) What are some practical reasons why dep_delay and arr_delay have a positive relationship? (LC3.3) What variables (not necessarily in the flights data frame) would you expect to have a negative correlation (i.e. a negative relationship) with dep_delay? Why? Remember that we are focusing on numerical variables here. (LC3.4) Why do you believe there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Alaskan flights? (LC3.5) What are some other features of the plot that stand out to you? (LC3.6) Create a new scatterplot using different variables in the alaska_flights data frame by modifying the example above. 3.3.2 Over-plotting The large mass of points near (0, 0) in Figure 3.2 can cause some confusion as it is hard to tell the true number of points that are plotted. This is the result of a phenomenon called overplotting. As one may guess, this corresponds to values being plotted on top of each other over and over again. It is often difficult to know just how many values are plotted in this way when looking at a basic scatterplot as we have here. There are two methods to address the issue of overplotting: By adjusting the transparency of the points. By adding a little random “jitter”, or random “nudges”, to each of the points. Method 1: Changing the transparency The first way of addressing overplotting is by changing the transparency of the points by using the alpha argument in geom_point(). By default, this value is set to 1. We can change this to any value between 0 and 1, where 0 sets the points to be 100% transparent and 1 sets the points to be 100% opaque. Note how the following code is identical to the code in Section 3.3 that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with alpha = 0.2 added to the geom_point(): ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) FIGURE 3.4: Delay scatterplot with alpha=0.2 The key feature to note in Figure 3.4 is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. Note furthermore that there is no aes() surrounding alpha = 0.2. This is because we are not mapping a variable to an aesthetic attribute, but rather merely changing the default setting of alpha. In fact, you’ll receive an error if you try to change the second line above to read geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2)). Method 2: Jittering the points The second way of addressing overplotting is by jittering all the points, in other words give each point a small nudge in a random direction. You can think of “jittering” as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Let’s illustrate using a simple example first. Say we have a data frame jitter_example with 4 rows of identical value 0 for both x and y: # A tibble: 4 x 2 x y &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 4 0 0 We display the resulting scatterplot in Figure 3.5; observe that the 4 points are superimposed on top of each other. While we know there are 4 values being plotted, this fact might not be apparent to others. FIGURE 3.5: Regular scatterplot of jitter example data In Figure 3.6 we instead display a jittered scatterplot where each point is given a random “nudge.” It is now plainly evident that this plot involves four points. Keep in mind that jittering is strictly a visualization tool; even after creating a jittered scatterplot, the original values saved in jitter_example remain unchanged. FIGURE 3.6: Jittered scatterplot of jitter example data To create a jittered scatterplot, instead of using geom_point(), we use geom_jitter(). To specify how much jitter to add, we adjust the width and height arguments. This corresponds to how hard you’d like to shake the plot in units corresponding to those for both the horizontal and vertical variables (in this case minutes). ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) FIGURE 3.7: Jittered delay scatterplot Observe how the above code is identical to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting in Subsection 3.3.1, but with geom_point() replaced with geom_jitter(). The resulting plot in Figure 3.7 helps us a little bit in getting a sense for the overplotting, but with a relatively large data set like this one (714 flights), it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting alpha proved more effective. In terms of how much jitter one should add using the width and height arguments, it is important to add just enough jitter to break any overlap in points, but not so much that we completely alter the overall pattern in points. Learning check (LC3.7) Why is setting the alpha argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? (LC3.8) After viewing the Figure 3.4 above, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur the most frequently. How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the alpha = 0.2 set in Figure 3.2? 3.3.3 Summary Scatterplots display the relationship between two numerical variables. They are among the most commonly used plots because they can provide an immediate way to see the trend in one variable versus another. However, if you try to create a scatterplot where either one of the two variables is not numerical, you might get strange results. Be careful! With medium to large data sets, you may need to play around with the different modifications one can make to a scatterplot. This tweaking is often a fun part of data visualization, since you’ll have the chance to see different relationships come about as you make subtle changes to your plots. 3.4 5NG#2: Linegraphs The next of the five named graphs are linegraphs. Linegraphs show the relationship between two numerical variables when the variable on the x-axis, also called the explanatory variable, is of a sequential nature; in other words there is an inherent ordering to the variable. The most common example of linegraphs have some notion of time on the x-axis: hours, days, weeks, years, etc. Since time is sequential, we connect consecutive observations of the variable on the y-axis with a line. Linegraphs that have some notion of time on the x-axis are also called time series plots. Linegraphs should be avoided when there is not a clear sequential ordering to the variable on the x-axis. Let’s illustrate linegraphs using another data set in the nycflights13 package: the weather data frame. Let’s get a sense for the weather data frame: Explore the weather data by running View(weather). Run ?weather to bring up the help file. We can see that there is a variable called temp of hourly temperature recordings in Fahrenheit at weather stations near all three airports in New York City: Newark (origin code EWR), JFK, and La Guardia (LGA). Instead of considering hourly temperatures for all days in 2013 for all three airports however, for simplicity let’s only consider hourly temperatures at only Newark airport for the first 15 days in January. Recall in Section 3.3 we used the filter() function to only choose the subset of rows of flights corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights. We similarly use filter() here, but by using the &amp; operator we only choose the subset of rows of weather where The origin is &quot;EWR&quot; and the month is January and the day is between 1 and 15 early_january_weather &lt;- weather %&gt;% filter(origin == &quot;EWR&quot; &amp; month == 1 &amp; day &lt;= 15) Learning check (LC3.9) Take a look at both the weather and early_january_weather data frames by running View(weather) and View(early_january_weather). In what respect do these data frames differ? (LC3.10) View() the flights data frame again. Why does the time_hour variable uniquely identify the hour of the measurement whereas the hour variable does not? 3.4.1 Linegraphs via geom_line Let’s plot a linegraph of hourly temperatures in early_january_weather by using geom_line() instead of geom_point() like we did for scatterplots: ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_line() FIGURE 3.8: Hourly Temperature in Newark for January 1-15, 2013 Much as with the ggplot() code that created the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights in Figure 3.2, let’s break down the above code piece-by-piece in terms of the Grammar of Graphics: Within the ggplot() function call, we specify two of the components of the Grammar of Graphics as arguments: The data frame to be early_january_weather by setting data = early_january_weather The aesthetic mapping by setting aes(x = time_hour, y = temp). Specifically: the variable time_hour maps to the x position aesthetic. the variable temp maps to the y position aesthetic We add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object in question. In this case the geometric object is a line, set by specifying geom_line(). Learning check (LC3.11) Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? (LC3.12) Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable on the x-axis? (LC3.13) Plot a time series of a variable other than temp for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013. 3.4.2 Summary Linegraphs, just like scatterplots, display the relationship between two numerical variables. However it is preferred to use linegraphs over scatterplots when the variable on the x-axis (i.e. the explanatory variable) has an inherent ordering, like some notion of time. 3.5 5NG#3: Histograms Let’s consider the temp variable in the weather data frame once again, but unlike with the linegraphs in Section 3.4, let’s say we don’t care about the relationship of temperature to time, but rather we only care about how the values of temp distribute. In other words: What are the smallest and largest values? What is the “center” value? How do the values spread out? What are frequent and infrequent values? One way to visualize this distribution of this single variable temp is to plot them on a horizontal line as we do in Figure 3.9: FIGURE 3.9: Plot of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013 This gives us a general idea of how the values of temp distribute: observe that temperatures vary from around 11°F up to 100°F. Furthermore, there appear to be more recorded temperatures between 40°F and 60°F than outside this range. However, because of the high degree of overlap in the points, it’s hard to get a sense of exactly how many values are between, say, 50°F and 55°F. What is commonly produced instead of the above plot is known as a histogram. A histogram is a plot that visualizes the distribution of a numerical value as follows: We first cut up the x-axis into a series of bins, where each bin represents a range of values. For each bin, we count the number of observations that fall in the range corresponding to that bin. Then for each bin, we draw a bar whose height marks the corresponding count. Let’s drill-down on an example of a histogram, shown in Figure 3.10. FIGURE 3.10: Example histogram. Observe that there are three bins of equal width between 30°F and 60°F, thus we have three bins of width 10°F each: one bin for the 30-40°F range, another bin for the 40-50°F range, and another bin for the 50-60°F range. Since: The bin for the 30-40°F range has a height of around 5000, this histogram is telling us that around 5000 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 30°F and 40°F. The bin for the 40-50°F range has a height of around 4300, this histogram is telling us that around 4300 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 40°F and 50°F. The bin for the 50-60°F range has a height of around 3500, this histogram is telling us that around 3500 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 50°F and 60°F. The remaining bins all have a similar interpretation. 3.5.1 Histograms via geom_histogram Let’s now present the ggplot() code to plot your first histogram! Unlike with scatterplots and linegraphs, there is now only one variable being mapped in aes(): the single numerical variable temp. The y-aesthetic of a histogram gets computed for you automatically. Furthermore, the geometric object layer is now a geom_histogram() ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram() `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). FIGURE 3.11: Histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports. Let’s unpack the messages R sent us first. The first message is telling us that the histogram was constructed using bins = 30, in other words 30 equally spaced bins. This is known in computer programming as a default value; unless you override this default number of bins with a number you specify, R will choose 30 by default. We’ll see in the next section how to change this default number of bins. The second message is telling us something similar to the warning message we received when we ran the code to create a scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights in Figure 3.2: that because one row has a missing NA value for temp, it was omitted from the histogram. R is just giving us a friendly heads up that this was the case. Now’s let’s unpack the resulting histogram in Figure 3.11. Observe that values less than 25°F as well as values above 80°F are rather rare. However, because of the large number of bins, its hard to get a sense for which range of temperatures is covered by each bin; everything is one giant amorphous blob. So let’s add white vertical borders demarcating the bins by adding a color = &quot;white&quot; argument to geom_histogram(): ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 3.12: Histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports with white borders. We can now better associate ranges of temperatures to each of the bins. We can also vary the color of the bars by setting the fill argument. Run colors() to see all 657 possible choice of colors! ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) FIGURE 3.13: Histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports with white borders. 3.5.2 Adjusting the bins Observe in both Figure 3.12 and Figure 3.13 that in the 50-75°F range there appear to be roughly 8 bins. Thus each bin has width 25 divided by 8, or roughly 3.12°F which is not a very easily interpretable range to work with. Let’s now adjust the number of bins in our histogram in one of two methods: By adjusting the number of bins via the bins argument to geom_histogram(). By adjusting the width of the bins via the binwidth argument to geom_histogram(). Using the first method, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to cut the x-axis up in. As mentioned in the previous section, the default number of bins is 30. We can override this default, to say 40 bins, as follows: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(bins = 40, color = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 3.14: Histogram with 40 bins. Using the second method, instead of specifying the number of bins, we specify the width of the bins by using the binwidth argument in the geom_histogram() layer. For example, let’s set the width of each bin to be 10°F. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 3.15: Histogram with binwidth 10. Learning check (LC3.14) What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 40 tell us about the distribution of temperatures? (LC3.15) Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed? (LC3.16) What would you guess is the “center” value in this distribution? Why did you make that choice? (LC3.17) Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close? Why? 3.5.3 Summary Histograms, unlike scatterplots and linegraphs, present information on only a single numerical variable. Specifically, they are visualizations of the distribution of the numerical variable in question. 3.6 Facets Before continuing the 5NG, let’s briefly introduce a new concept called faceting. Faceting is used when we’d like to split a particular visualization of variables by another variable. This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ. For example, suppose we were interested in looking at how the histogram of hourly temperature recordings at the three NYC airports we saw in Section 3.5 differed by month. We would “split” this histogram by the 12 possible months in a given year, in other words plot histograms of temp for each month. We do this by adding facet_wrap(~ month) layer. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ month) FIGURE 3.16: Faceted histogram. Note the use of the tilde ~ before month in facet_wrap(). The tilde is required and you’ll receive the error Error in as.quoted(facets) : object 'month' not found if you don’t include it before month here. We can also specify the number of rows and columns in the grid by using the nrow and ncol arguments inside of facet_wrap(). For example, say we would like our faceted plot to have 4 rows instead of 3. Add the nrow = 4 argument to facet_wrap(~ month) ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ month, nrow = 4) FIGURE 3.17: Faceted histogram with 4 instead of 3 rows. Observe in both Figure 3.16 and Figure 3.17 that as we might expect in the Northern Hemisphere, temperatures tend to be higher in the summer months, while they tend to be lower in the winter. Learning check (LC3.18) What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above? How does a faceted plot help us see relationships between two variables? (LC3.19) What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above? What about 25, 50, 75, 100? (LC3.20) For which types of data sets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the nature of these variables and other important characteristics. (LC3.21) Does the temp variable in the weather data set have a lot of variability? Why do you say that? 3.7 5NG#4: Boxplots While faceted histograms are one visualization that allows us to compare distributions of a numerical variable split by another variable, another visualization that achieves this same goal are side-by-side boxplots. A boxplot is constructed from the information provided in the five-number summary of a numerical variable (see Appendix A). To keep things simple for now, let’s only consider hourly temperature recordings for the month of November in Figure 3.18. FIGURE 3.18: November temperatures. These 2141 observations have the following five-number summary: Minimum: 21.02°F First quartile AKA 25th percentile: 35.96°F Median AKA second quartile AKA 50th percentile: 44.96°F Third quartile AKA 75th percentile: 51.98°F Maximum: 71.06°F Let’s mark these 5 values with dashed horizontal lines in Figure 3.19. FIGURE 3.19: November temperatures. Let’s add the boxplot underneath these points and dashed horizontal lines in Figure 3.20. FIGURE 3.20: November temperatures. What the boxplot does summarize the 2141 points by emphasizing that: 25% of points (about 534 observations) fall below the bottom edge of the box, which is the first quartile of 35.96°F. In other words 25% of observations were colder than 35.96°F. 25% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line, which is the median of 44.96°F. In other words 25% of observations were between 35.96 and 44.96°F and 50% of observations were colder than 44.96°F. 25% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box, which is the third quartile of 51.98°F. In other words 25% of observations were between 44.96 and 51.98°F and 75% of observations were colder than 51.98°F. 25% of points fall over the top edge of the box. In other words 25% of observations were warmer than 51.98°F. The middle 50% of points lie within the interquartile range between the first and third quartile of 51.98 - 35.96 = 16.02°F. Lastly, for clarity’s sake let’s remove the points but keep the dashed horizontal lines in Figure 3.21. FIGURE 3.21: November temperatures. We can now better see the whiskers of the boxplot. They stick out from either end of the box all the way to the minimum and maximum observed temperatures of 21.02°F and 71.06°F respectively. However, the whiskers don’t always extend to the smallest and largest observed values. They in fact can extend no more than 1.5 \\(\\times\\) the interquartile range from either end of the box, in this case 1.5 \\(\\times\\) 16.02°F = 24.03°F from either end of the box. Any observed values outside this whiskers get marked with points called outliers, which we’ll see in the next section. 3.7.1 Boxplots via geom_boxplot Let’s now create a side-by-side boxplot of hourly temperatures split by the 12 months as we did above with the faceted histograms. We do this by mapping the month variable to the x-position aesthetic, the temp variable to the y-position aesthetic, and by adding a geom_boxplot() layer: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = temp)) + geom_boxplot() FIGURE 3.22: Invalid boxplot specification Warning messages: 1: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? 2: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). Observe in Figure 3.22 that this plot does not provide information about temperature separated by month. The warning messages clue us in as to why. The second warning message is identical to the warning message when plotting a histogram of hourly temperatures: that one of the values was recorded as NA missing. However, the first warning message is telling us that we have a “continuous”, or numerical variable, on the x-position aesthetic. Boxplots however require a categorical variable on the x-axis. We can convert the numerical variable month into a categorical variable by using the factor() function. So after applying factor(month), month goes from having numerical values 1, 2, …, 12 to having labels “1”, “2”, …, “12.” ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) + geom_boxplot() FIGURE 3.23: Month by temp boxplot The resulting Figure 3.23 shows 12 separate “box and whiskers” plots with the features we saw earlier focusing only on November: The “box” portions of this visualization represent the 1st quartile, the median AKA the 2nd quartile, and the 3rd quartile. The height of each box, i.e. the value of the 3rd quartile minus the value of the 1st quartile, is the interquartile range. It is a measure of spread of the middle 50% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability. The “whisker” portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and represent points less than the 25th percentile and greater than the 75th percentiles respectively. They’re set to extend out no more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) units away from either end of the boxes. We say “no more than” because the ends of the whiskers have to correspond to observed temperatures. The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability. The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called outliers. These can be thought of as anomalous values. It is important to keep in mind that the definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) units long. Looking at this plot we can see, as expected, that summer months (6 through 8) have higher median temperatures as evidenced by the higher solid lines in the middle of the boxes. We can easily compare temperatures across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the height of the 12 boxes as quantified by the interquartile ranges are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of temperatures recorded in a given month. Learning check (LC3.22) What does the dot at the bottom of the plot for May correspond to? Explain what might have occurred in May to produce this point. (LC3.23) Which months have the highest variability in temperature? What reasons can you give for this? (LC3.24) We looked at the distribution of the numerical variable temp split by the numerical variable month that we converted to a categorical variable using the factor() function. Why would a boxplot of temp split by the numerical variable pressure similarly converted to a categorical variable using the factor() not be informative? (LC3.25) Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers. Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram? 3.7.2 Summary Side-by-side boxplots provide us with a way to compare and contrast the distribution of a quantitative variable across multiple levels of another categorical variable. One can see where the median falls across the different groups by looking at the center line in the boxes. To see how spread out the variable is across the different groups, look at both the width of the box and also how far the whiskers stretch out away from the box. Outliers are even more easily identified when looking at a boxplot than when looking at a histogram as they are marked with points. 3.8 5NG#5: Barplots Both histograms and boxplots are tools to visualize the distribution of numerical variables. Another common task is visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, as we are simply counting different categories, also known as levels, of a categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts, also known as frequencies, is with a barplot (also known as a barchart). One complication, however, is how your data is represented: is the categorical variable of interest “pre-counted” or not? For example, run the following code that manually creates two data frames representing a collection of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. fruits &lt;- data_frame( fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;) ) fruits_counted &lt;- data_frame( fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), number = c(3, 2) ) We see both the fruits and fruits_counted data frames represent the same collection of fruit. Whereas fruits just lists the fruit individually… # A tibble: 5 x 1 fruit &lt;chr&gt; 1 apple 2 apple 3 orange 4 apple 5 orange … fruits_counted has a variable count which represents pre-counted values of each fruit. # A tibble: 2 x 2 fruit number &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 apple 3 2 orange 2 Depending on how your categorical data is represented, you’ll need to use add a different geom layer to your ggplot() to create a barplot, as we now explore. 3.8.1 Barplots via geom_bar or geom_col Let’s generate barplots using these two different representations of the same basket of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. Using the fruits data frame where all 5 fruits are listed individually in 5 rows, we map the fruit variable to the x-position aesthetic and add a geom_bar() layer. ggplot(data = fruits, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 3.24: Barplot when counts are not pre-counted However, using the fruits_counted data frame where the fruit have been “pre-counted”, we map the fruit variable to the x-position aesthetic as with geom_bar(), but we also map the count variable to the y-position aesthetic, and add a geom_col() layer. ggplot(data = fruits_counted, mapping = aes(x = fruit, y = number)) + geom_col() FIGURE 3.25: Barplot when counts are pre-counted Compare the barplots in Figures 3.24 and 3.25. They are identical because they reflect count of the same 5 fruit. However depending on how our data is saved, either pre-counted or not, we must add a different geom layer. When the categorical variable whose distribution you want to visualize is: Is not pre-counted in your data frame: use geom_bar(). Is pre-counted in your data frame, use geom_col() with the y-position aesthetic mapped to the variable that has the counts. Let’s now go back to the flights data frame in the nycflights13 package and visualize the distribution of the categorical variable carrier. In other words, let’s visualize the number of domestic flights out of the three New York City airports each airline company flew in 2013. Recall from Section 2.4.3 when you first explored the flights data frame you saw that each row corresponds to a flight. In other words the flights data frame is more like the fruits data frame than the fruits_counted data frame above, and thus we should use geom_bar() instead of geom_col() to create a barplot. Much like a geom_histogram(), there is only one variable in the aes() aesthetic mapping: the variable carrier gets mapped to the x-position. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 3.26: Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline using geom_bar Observe in Figure 3.26 that United Air Lines (UA), JetBlue Airways (B6), and ExpressJet Airlines (EV) had the most flights depart New York City in 2013. If you don’t know which airlines correspond to which carrier codes, then run View(airlines) to see a directory of airlines. For example: AA is American Airlines; B6 is JetBlue Airways; DL is Delta Airlines; EV is ExpressJet Airlines; MQ is Envoy Air; while UA is United Airlines. Alternatively, say you had a data frame flights_counted where the number of flights for each carrier was pre-counted like in Table 3.3. TABLE 3.3: Number of flights pre-counted for each carrier. carrier number 9E 18460 AA 32729 AS 714 B6 54635 DL 48110 EV 54173 F9 685 FL 3260 HA 342 MQ 26397 OO 32 UA 58665 US 20536 VX 5162 WN 12275 YV 601 In order to create a barplot visualizing the distribution of the categorical variable carrier in this case, we would use geom_col() instead with x mapped to carrier and y mapped to number as seen below. The resulting barplot would be identical to Figure 3.26. ggplot(data = flights_table, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = number)) + geom_col() Learning check (LC3.26) Why are histograms inappropriate for visualizing categorical variables? (LC3.27) What is the difference between histograms and barplots? (LC3.28) How many Envoy Air flights departed NYC in 2013? (LC3.29) What was the seventh highest airline in terms of departed flights from NYC in 2013? How could we better present the table to get this answer quickly? 3.8.2 Must avoid pie charts! Unfortunately, one of the most common plots seen today for categorical data is the pie chart. While they may seem harmless enough, they actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well. As Naomi Robbins describes in her book “Creating More Effective Graphs” (Robbins 2013), we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees. In other words, it is difficult for us to determine relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another. Let’s examine the same data used in our previous barplot of the number of flights departing NYC by airline in Figure 3.26, but this time we will use a pie chart in Figure 3.27. FIGURE 3.27: The dreaded pie chart Try to answer the following questions: How much larger the portion of the pie is for ExpressJet Airlines (EV) compared to US Airways (US), What the third largest carrier is in terms of departing flights, and How many carriers have fewer flights than United Airlines (UA)? While it is quite difficult to answer these questions when looking at the pie chart in Figure 3.27, we can much more easily answer these questions using the barchart in Figure 3.26. This is true since barplots present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories can be made with single horizontal lines, whereas pie charts present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories must be made by comparing angles. There may be one exception of a pie chart not to avoid courtesy Nathan Yau at FlowingData.com, but we will leave this for the reader to decide: FIGURE 3.28: The only good pie chart Learning check (LC3.30) Why should pie charts be avoided and replaced by barplots? (LC3.31) Why do you think people continue to use pie charts? 3.8.3 Two categorical variables Barplots are the go-to way to visualize the frequency of different categories, or levels, of a single categorical variable. Another use of barplots is to visualize the joint distribution of two categorical variables at the same time. Let’s examine the joint distribution of outgoing domestic flights from NYC by carrier and origin, or in other words the number of flights for each carrier and origin combination. For example, the number of WestJet flights from JFK, the number of WestJet flights from LGA, the number of WestJet flights from EWR, the number of American Airlines flights from JFK, and so on. Recall the ggplot() code that created the barplot of carrier frequency in Figure 3.26: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() We can now map the additional variable origin by adding a fill = origin inside the aes() aesthetic mapping; the fill aesthetic of any bar corresponds to the color used to fill the bars. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 3.29: Stacked barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and origin. Figure 3.29 is an example of a stacked barplot. While simple to make, in certain aspects it is not ideal. For example, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors between the bars, corresponding to comparing the number of flights from each origin airport between the carriers. Before we continue, let’s address some common points of confusion amongst new R users. First, note that fill is another aesthetic mapping much like x-position; thus it must be included within the parentheses of the aes() mapping. The following code, where the fill aesthetic is specified outside the aes() mapping will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new ggplot users make: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier), fill = origin) + geom_bar() Second, the fill aesthetic corresponds to the color used to fill the bars, while the color aesthetic corresponds to the color of the outline of the bars. Observe in Figure 3.30 that mapping origin to color and not fill yields grey bars with different colored outlines. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, color = origin)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 3.30: Stacked barplot with color aesthetic used instead of fill. Learning check (LC3.32) What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure? (LC3.33) What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights? Another alternative to stacked barplots are side-by-side barplots, also known as a dodged barplot. The code to created a side-by-side barplot is identical to the code to create a stacked barplot, but with a position = &quot;dodge&quot; argument added to geom_bar(). In other words, we are overriding the default barplot type, which is a stacked barplot, and specifying it to be a side-by-side barplot. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) FIGURE 3.31: Side-by-side AKA dodged barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and origin. Learning check (LC3.34) Why might the side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case? (LC3.35) What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot, in general? Lastly, another type of barplot is a faceted barplot. Recall in Section 3.6 we visualized the distribution of hourly temperatures at the 3 NYC airports split by month using facets. We apply the same principle to our barplot visualizing the frequency of carrier split by origin: instead of mapping origin ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ origin, ncol = 1) FIGURE 3.32: Faceted barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and origin. Learning check (LC3.36) Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case? (LC3.37) What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot? 3.8.4 Summary Barplots are the preferred way of displaying the distribution of a categorical variable, or in other words the frequency with which the different categories called levels occur. They are easy to understand and make it easy to make comparisons across levels. When trying to visualize two categorical variables, you have many options: stacked barplots, side-by-side barplots, and faceted barplots. Depending on what aspect of the joint distribution you are trying to emphasize, you will need to make a choice between these three types of barplots. 3.9 Conclusion 3.9.1 Summary table Let’s recap all five of the Five Named Graphs (5NG) in Table 3.4 summarizing their differences. Using these 5NG, you’ll be able to visualize the distributions and relationships of variables contained in a wide array of datasets. This will be even more the case as we start to map more variables to more of each geometric object’s aesthetic attribute options, further unlocking the awesome power of the ggplot2 package. TABLE 3.4: Summary of 5NG Named graph Shows Geometric object Notes 1 Scatterplot Relationship between 2 numerical variables geom_point() 2 Linegraph Relationship between 2 numerical variables geom_line() Used when there is a sequential order to x-variable e.g. time 3 Histogram Distribution of 1 numerical variable geom_histogram() Facetted histograms show the distribution of 1 numerical variable split by values of another variable 4 Boxplot Distribution of 1 numerical variable split by 1 categorical variable geom_boxplot() 5 Barplot Distribution of 1 categorical variable geom_bar() when counts are not pre-counted, geom_col() when counts are pre-counted Stacked, side-by-side, and faceted barplots show the joint distribution of 2 categorical variables 3.9.2 Argument specification Run the following two segments of code. First this: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() then this: ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() You’ll notice that that both code segments create the same barplot, even though in the second segment we omitted the data = and mapping = code argument names. This is because the ggplot() by default assumes that the data argument comes first and the mapping argument comes second. So as long as you specify the data frame in question first and the aes() mapping second, you can omit the explicit statement of the argument names data = and mapping =. Going forward for the rest of this book, all ggplot() will be like the second segment above: with the data = and mapping = explicit naming of the argument omitted and the default ordering of arguments respected. 3.9.3 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. If you want to further unlock the power of the ggplot2 package for data visualization, we suggest you that you check out RStudio’s “Data Visualization with ggplot2” cheatsheet. This cheatsheet summarizes much more than what we’ve discussed in this chapter, in particular the many more than the 5 geom geometric objects we covered in this Chapter, while providing quick and easy to read visual descriptions. You can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -&gt; Help -&gt; Cheatsheets -&gt; “Data Visualization with ggplot2”: FIGURE 3.33: Data Visualization with ggplot2 cheatsheat 3.9.4 What’s to come Recall in Figure 3.2 in Section 3.3 we visualized the relationship between departure delay and arrival delay for Alaska Airlines flights. This necessitated paring down the flights data frame to a new data frame alaska_flights consisting of only carrier == AS flights first: alaska_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;) ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point() Furthermore recall in Figure 3.8 in Section 3.4 we visualized hourly temperature recordings at Newark airport only for the first 15 days of January 2013. This necessitated paring down the weather data frame to a new data frame early_january_weather consisting of hourly temperature recordings only for origin == &quot;EWR&quot;, month == 1, and day less than or equal to 15 first: early_january_weather &lt;- weather %&gt;% filter(origin == &quot;EWR&quot; &amp; month == 1 &amp; day &lt;= 15) ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_line() These two code segments were a preview of Chapter 4 on data wrangling where we’ll delve further into the dplyr package. Data wrangling is the process of transforming and modifying existing data with the intent of making it more appropriate for analysis purposes. For example, the two code segments used the filter() function to create new data frames (alaska_flights and early_january_weather) by choosing only a subset of rows of existing data frames (flights and weather). In this next chapter, we’ll formally introduce the filter() and other data wrangling functions as well as the pipe operator %&gt;% which allows you to combine multiple data wrangling actions into a single sequential chain of actions.

In particular we studied what we term the “five named graphs” (5NG): scatterplots via geom_point() linegraphs via geom_line() boxplots via geom_boxplot() histograms via geom_histogram() barplots via geom_bar() or geom_col() We created these visualizations using the “Grammar of Graphics”, which maps variables in a data frame to the aesthetic attributes of one the above 5 geometric objects. We can also control other aesthetic attributes of the geometric objects such as the size and color as seen in the Gapminder data example in Figure 3.1. Recall however in Section 3.9.4 we discussed that for two of our visualizations we needed transformed/modified versions of existing data frames. Recall for example the scatterplot of departure and arrival delay only for Alaska Airlines flights. In order to create this visualization, we needed to first pare down the flights data frame to a new data frame alaska_flights consisting of only carrier == &quot;AS&quot; flights using the filter() function. alaska_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;) ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point() In this chapter, we’ll introduce a series of functions from the dplyr package that will allow you to take a data frame and filter() its existing rows to only pick out a subset of them. For example, the alaska_flights data frame above. summarize() one of its columns/variables with a summary statistic. Examples include the median and interquartile range of temperatures as we saw in Section 3.7 on boxplots. group_by() its rows. In other words assign different rows to be part of the same group and report summary statistics for each group separately. For example, say perhaps you don’t want a single overall average departure delay dep_delay for all three origin airports combined, but rather three separate average departure delays, one for each of the three origin airports. mutate() its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, convert hourly temperature recordings from °F to °C. arrange() its rows. For example, sort the rows of weather in ascending or descending order of temp. join() it with another data frame by matching along a “key” variable. In other words, merge these two data frames together. Notice how we used computer code font to describe the actions we want to take on our data frames. This is because the dplyr package for data wrangling that we’ll introduce in this chapter has intuitively verb-named functions that are easy to remember. We’ll start by introducing the pipe operator %&gt;%, which allows you to combine multiple data wrangling verb-named functions into a single sequential chain of actions. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(nycflights13) 4.1 The pipe operator: %&gt;% Before we start data wrangling, let’s first introduce a very nifty tool that gets loaded along with the dplyr package: the pipe operator %&gt;%. Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h(): Take x then Use x as an input to a function f() then Use the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then Use the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h() One way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows: h(g(f(x))) The above code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h(). However, you can imagine that this can get progressively harder and harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases. This is where the pipe operator %&gt;% comes in handy. %&gt;% takes one output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read %&gt;% as “then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the above sequence of operations as follows: x %&gt;% f() %&gt;% g() %&gt;% h() You would read this above sequence as: Take x then Use this output as the input to the next function f() then Use this output as the input to the next function g() then Use this output as the input to the next function h() So while both approaches above would achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can read the sequence of operations line-by-line. But what are the hypothetical x, f(), g(), and h()? Throughout this chapter on data wrangling: The starting value x will be a data frame. For example: flights. The sequence of functions, here f(), g(), and h(), will be a sequence of any number of the 6 data wrangling verb-named functions we listed in the introduction to this chapter. For example: filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;). The result will the transformed/modified data frame that you want. For example: a data frame consisting of only the subset of rows in flights corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights. Much like when adding layers to a ggplot() using the + sign at the end of lines, you form a single chain of data wrangling operations by combining verb-named functions into a single sequence with pipe operators %&gt;% at the end of lines. So continuing our example involving Alaska Airlines flights, we form a chain using the pipe operator %&gt;% and save the resulting data frame in alaska_flights: alaska_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;) Keep in mind, there are many more advanced data wrangling functions than just the 6 listed in the introduction to this chapter; you’ll see some examples of these near in Section 4.8. However, just with these 6 verb-named functions you’ll be able to perform a broad array of data wrangling tasks for the rest of this book. 4.2 filter rows FIGURE 4.1: Diagram of The filter() function here works much like the “Filter” option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variables in your dataset and then filters out only those rows that match that criteria. We begin by focusing only on flights from New York City to Portland, Oregon. The dest code (or airport code) for Portland, Oregon is &quot;PDX&quot;. Run the following and look at the resulting spreadsheet to ensure that only flights heading to Portland are chosen here: portland_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(dest == &quot;PDX&quot;) View(portland_flights) Note the following: The ordering of the commands: Take the flights data frame flights then filter the data frame so that only those where the dest equals &quot;PDX&quot; are included. We test for equality using the double equal sign == and not a single equal sign =. In other words filter(dest = &quot;PDX&quot;) will yield an error. This is a convention across many programming languages. If you are new to coding, you’ll probably forget to use the double equal sign == a few times before you get the hang of it. You can use other mathematical operations beyond just == to form criteria: &gt; corresponds to “greater than” &lt; corresponds to “less than” &gt;= corresponds to “greater than or equal to” &lt;= corresponds to “less than or equal to” != corresponds to “not equal to”. The ! is used in many programming languages to indicate “not”. Furthermore, you can combine multiple criteria together using operators that make comparisons: | corresponds to “or” &amp; corresponds to “and” To see many of these in action, let’s filter flights for all rows that: Departed from JFK airport and Were heading to Burlington, Vermont (&quot;BTV&quot;) or Seattle, Washington (&quot;SEA&quot;) and Departed in the months of October, November, or December. Run the following: btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(origin == &quot;JFK&quot; &amp; (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;) &amp; month &gt;= 10) View(btv_sea_flights_fall) Note that even though colloquially speaking one might say “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont and Seattle, Washington,” in terms of computer operations, we really mean “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont or leaving Seattle, Washington.” For a given row in the data, dest can be “BTV”, “SEA”, or something else, but not “BTV” and “SEA” at the same time. Furthermore, note the careful use of parentheses around the dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;. We can often skip the use of &amp; and just separate our conditions with a comma. In other words the code above will return the identical output btv_sea_flights_fall as this code below: btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(origin == &quot;JFK&quot;, (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;), month &gt;= 10) View(btv_sea_flights_fall) Let’s present another example that uses the ! “not” operator to pick rows that don’t match a criteria. As mentioned earlier, the ! can be read as “not.” Here we are filtering rows corresponding to flights that didn’t go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA. not_BTV_SEA &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(!(dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;)) View(not_BTV_SEA) Again, note the careful use of parentheses around the (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;). If we didn’t use parentheses as follows: flights %&gt;% filter(!dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;) We would be returning all flights not headed to &quot;BTV&quot; or those headed to &quot;SEA&quot;, which is an entirely different resulting data frame. Now say we have a large list of airports we want to filter for, say BTV, SEA, PDX, SFO, and BDL. We could continue to use the | or operator as so: many_airports &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot; | dest == &quot;PDX&quot; | dest == &quot;SFO&quot; | dest == &quot;BDL&quot;) View(many_airports) but as we progressively include more airports, this will get unwieldy. A slightly shorter approach uses the %in% operator: many_airports &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(dest %in% c(&quot;BTV&quot;, &quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;PDX&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;BDL&quot;)) View(many_airports) What this code is doing is filtering flights for all flights where dest is in the list of airports c(&quot;BTV&quot;, &quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;PDX&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;BDL&quot;). Recall from Chapter 2 that the c() function “combines” or “concatenates” values in a vector of values. Both outputs of many_airports are the same, but as you can see the latter takes much less time to code. As a final note we point out that filter() should often be among the first verbs you apply to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about, or put differently, it narrows down the scope of your data frame to just the observations your care about. Learning check (LC4.1) What’s another way of using the “not” operator ! to filter only the rows that are not going to Burlington VT nor Seattle WA in the flights data frame? Test this out using the code above. 4.3 summarize variables The next common task when working with data is to return summary statistics: a single numerical value that summarizes a large number of values, for example the mean/average or the median. Other examples of summary statistics that might not immediately come to mind include the sum, the smallest value AKA the minimum, the largest value AKA the maximum, and the standard deviation; they are all summaries of a large number of values. FIGURE 4.2: Summarize diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet FIGURE 4.3: Another summarize diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet Let’s calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the temperature variable temp in the weather data frame included in the nycflights13 package (See Appendix A). We’ll do this in one step using the summarize() function from the dplyr package and save the results in a new data frame summary_temp with columns/variables mean and the std_dev. Note you can also use the UK spelling of “summarise” using the summarise() function. As shown in Figures 4.2 and 4.3, the weather data frame’s many rows will be collapsed into a single row of just the summary values, in this case the mean and standard deviation: summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp), std_dev = sd(temp)) summary_temp # A tibble: 1 x 2 mean std_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 NA NA Why are the values returned NA? As we saw in Section 3.3.1 when creating the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for alaska_flights, NA is how R encodes missing values where NA indicates “not available” or “not applicable.” If a value for a particular row and a particular column does not exist, NA is stored instead. Values can be missing for many reasons. Perhaps the data was collected but someone forgot to enter it? Perhaps the data was not collected at all because it was too difficult? Perhaps there was an erroneous value that someone entered that has been correct to read as missing? You’ll often encounter issues with missing values when working with real data. Going back to our summary_temp output above, by default any time you try to calculate a summary statistic of a variable that has one or more NA missing values in R, then NA is returned. To work around this fact, you can set the na.rm argument to TRUE, where rm is short for “remove”; this will ignore any NA missing values and only return the summary value for all non-missing values. The code below computes the mean and standard deviation of all non-missing values of temp. Notice how the na.rm=TRUE are used as arguments to the mean() and sd() functions individually, and not to the summarize() function. summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_temp # A tibble: 1 x 2 mean std_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 55.3 17.8 However, one needs to be cautious whenever ignoring missing values as we’ve done above. In the upcoming Learning Checks we’ll consider the possible ramifications of blindly sweeping rows with missing values “under the rug.” This is in fact why the na.rm argument to any summary statistic function in R has is set to FALSE by default; in other words, do not ignore rows with missing values by default. R is alerting you to the presence of missing data and you should by mindful of this missingness and any potential causes of this missingness throughtout your analysis. What are other summary statistic functions can we use inside the summarize() verb? As seen in Figure 4.3, you can use any function in R that takes many values and returns just one. Here are just a few: mean(): the mean AKA the average sd(): the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread min() and max(): the minimum and maximum values respectively IQR(): Interquartile range sum(): the sum n(): a count of the number of rows/observations in each group. This particular summary function will make more sense when group_by() is covered in Section 4.4. Learning check (LC4.2) Say a doctor is studying the effect of smoking on lung cancer for a large number of patients who have records measured at five year intervals. She notices that a large number of patients have missing data points because the patient has died, so she chooses to ignore these patients in her analysis. What is wrong with this doctor’s approach? (LC4.3) Modify the above summarize function to create summary_temp to also use the n() summary function: summarize(count = n()). What does the returned value correspond to? (LC4.4) Why doesn’t the following code work? Run the code line by line instead of all at once, and then look at the data. In other words, run summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) first. summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% summarize(std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) 4.4 group_by rows FIGURE 4.4: Group by and summarize diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet Say instead of the a single mean temperature for the whole year, you would like 12 mean temperatures, one for each of the 12 months separately? In other words, we would like to compute the mean temperature split by month AKA sliced by month AKA aggregated by month. We can do this by “grouping” temperature observations by the values of another variable, in this case by the 12 values of the variable month. Run the following code: summary_monthly_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_monthly_temp month mean std_dev 1 35.6 10.22 2 34.3 6.98 3 39.9 6.25 4 51.7 8.79 5 61.8 9.68 6 72.2 7.55 7 80.1 7.12 8 74.5 5.19 9 67.4 8.47 10 60.1 8.85 11 45.0 10.44 12 38.4 9.98 This code is identical to the previous code that created summary_temp, but with an extra group_by(month) added before the summarize(). Grouping the weather dataset by month and then applying the summarize() functions yields a data frame that displays the mean and standard deviation temperature split by the 12 months of the year. It is important to note that the group_by() function doesn’t change data frames by itself. Rather it changes the meta-data, or data about the data, specifically the group structure. It is only after we apply the summarize() function that the data frame changes. For example, let’s consider the diamonds data frame included in the ggplot2 package. Run this code, specifically in the console: diamonds # A tibble: 53,940 x 10 carat cut color clarity depth table price x y z &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.23 Ideal E SI2 61.5 55 326 3.95 3.98 2.43 2 0.21 Premium E SI1 59.8 61 326 3.89 3.84 2.31 3 0.23 Good E VS1 56.9 65 327 4.05 4.07 2.31 4 0.290 Premium I VS2 62.4 58 334 4.2 4.23 2.63 5 0.31 Good J SI2 63.3 58 335 4.34 4.35 2.75 6 0.24 Very Good J VVS2 62.8 57 336 3.94 3.96 2.48 7 0.24 Very Good I VVS1 62.3 57 336 3.95 3.98 2.47 8 0.26 Very Good H SI1 61.9 55 337 4.07 4.11 2.53 9 0.22 Fair E VS2 65.1 61 337 3.87 3.78 2.49 10 0.23 Very Good H VS1 59.4 61 338 4 4.05 2.39 # … with 53,930 more rows Observe that the first line of the output reads # A tibble: 53,940 x 10. This is an example of meta-data, in this case the number of observations/rows and variables/columns in diamonds. The actual data itself are the subsequent table of values. Now let’s pipe the diamonds data frame into group_by(cut). Run this code, specifically in the console: diamonds %&gt;% group_by(cut) # A tibble: 53,940 x 10 # Groups: cut [5] carat cut color clarity depth table price x y z &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.23 Ideal E SI2 61.5 55 326 3.95 3.98 2.43 2 0.21 Premium E SI1 59.8 61 326 3.89 3.84 2.31 3 0.23 Good E VS1 56.9 65 327 4.05 4.07 2.31 4 0.290 Premium I VS2 62.4 58 334 4.2 4.23 2.63 5 0.31 Good J SI2 63.3 58 335 4.34 4.35 2.75 6 0.24 Very Good J VVS2 62.8 57 336 3.94 3.96 2.48 7 0.24 Very Good I VVS1 62.3 57 336 3.95 3.98 2.47 8 0.26 Very Good H SI1 61.9 55 337 4.07 4.11 2.53 9 0.22 Fair E VS2 65.1 61 337 3.87 3.78 2.49 10 0.23 Very Good H VS1 59.4 61 338 4 4.05 2.39 # … with 53,930 more rows Observe that now there is additional meta-data: # Groups: cut [5] indicating that the grouping structure meta-data has been set based on the 5 possible values AKA levels of the categorical variable cut: &quot;Fair&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Very Good&quot;, &quot;Premium&quot;, &quot;Ideal&quot;. On the other hand observe that the data has not changed: it is still a table of 53,940 \\(\\times\\) 10 values. Only by combining a group_by() with another data wrangling operation, in this case summarize() will the actual data be transformed. diamonds %&gt;% group_by(cut) %&gt;% summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) # A tibble: 5 x 2 cut avg_price &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Fair 4359. 2 Good 3929. 3 Very Good 3982. 4 Premium 4584. 5 Ideal 3458.

For example, suppose we’d like to count how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City: by_origin &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(origin) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) by_origin # A tibble: 3 x 2 origin count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 EWR 120835 2 JFK 111279 3 LGA 104662 We see that Newark (&quot;EWR&quot;) had the most flights departing in 2013 followed by &quot;JFK&quot; and lastly by LaGuardia (&quot;LGA&quot;). Note there is a subtle but important difference between sum() and n(); While sum() returns the sum of a numerical variable, n() returns counts of the the number of rows/observations. 4.4.1 Grouping by more than one variable You are not limited to grouping by one variable! Say you wanted to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports for each month, we can also group by a second variable month: group_by(origin, month). We see there are 36 rows to by_origin_monthly because there are 12 months for 3 airports (EWR, JFK, and LGA). by_origin_monthly &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(origin, month) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) by_origin_monthly # A tibble: 36 x 3 # Groups: origin [3] origin month count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 EWR 1 9893 2 EWR 2 9107 3 EWR 3 10420 4 EWR 4 10531 5 EWR 5 10592 6 EWR 6 10175 7 EWR 7 10475 8 EWR 8 10359 9 EWR 9 9550 10 EWR 10 10104 # … with 26 more rows Why do we group_by(origin, month) and not group_by(origin) and then group_by(month)? Let’s investigate: by_origin_monthly_incorrect &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(origin) %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) by_origin_monthly_incorrect # A tibble: 12 x 2 month count &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 27004 2 2 24951 3 3 28834 4 4 28330 5 5 28796 6 6 28243 7 7 29425 8 8 29327 9 9 27574 10 10 28889 11 11 27268 12 12 28135 What happened here is that the second group_by(month) overrode the group structure meta-data of the first group_by(origin), so that in the end we are only grouping by month. The lesson here is if you want to group_by() two or more variables, you should include all these variables in a single group_by() function call. Learning check (LC4.5) Recall from Chapter 3 when we looked at plots of temperatures by months in NYC. What does the standard deviation column in the summary_monthly_temp data frame tell us about temperatures in New York City throughout the year? (LC4.6) What code would be required to get the mean and standard deviation temperature for each day in 2013 for NYC? (LC4.7) Recreate by_monthly_origin, but instead of grouping via group_by(origin, month), group variables in a different order group_by(month, origin). What differs in the resulting dataset? (LC4.8) How could we identify how many flights left each of the three airports for each carrier? (LC4.9) How does the filter operation differ from a group_by followed by a summarize? 4.5 mutate existing variables FIGURE 4.5: Mutate diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet Another common transformation of data is to create/compute new variables based on existing ones. For example, say you are more comfortable thinking of temperature in degrees Celsius °C and not degrees Farenheit °F. The formula to convert temperatures from °F to °C is: \\[ \\text{temp in C} = \\frac{\\text{temp in F} - 32}{1.8} \\] We can apply this formula to the temp variable using the mutate() function, which takes existing variables and mutates them to create new ones. weather &lt;- weather %&gt;% mutate(temp_in_C = (temp-32)/1.8) View(weather) Note that we have overwritten the original weather data frame with a new version that now includes the additional variable temp_in_C. In other words, the mutate() command outputs a new data frame which then gets saved over the original weather data frame. Furthermore, note how in mutate() we used temp_in_C = (temp-32)/1.8 to create a new variable temp_in_C. Why did we overwrite the data frame weather instead of assigning the result to a new data frame like weather_new, but on the other hand why did we not overwrite temp, but instead created a new variable called temp_in_C? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing original information that you might need later, it’s acceptable practice to overwrite existing data frames. On the other hand, had we used mutate(temp = (temp-32)/1.8) instead of mutate(temp_in_C = (temp-32)/1.8), we would have overwritten the original variable temp and lost its values. Let’s compute average monthly temperatures in both °F and °C using the similar group_by() and summarize() code as in the previous section. summary_monthly_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(mean_temp_in_F = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), mean_temp_in_C = mean(temp_in_C, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_monthly_temp # A tibble: 12 x 3 month mean_temp_in_F mean_temp_in_C &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 35.6 2.02 2 2 34.3 1.26 3 3 39.9 4.38 4 4 51.7 11.0 5 5 61.8 16.6 6 6 72.2 22.3 7 7 80.1 26.7 8 8 74.5 23.6 9 9 67.4 19.7 10 10 60.1 15.6 11 11 45.0 7.22 12 12 38.4 3.58 Let’s consider another example. Passengers are often frustrated when their flights depart late, but change their mood a bit if pilots can make up some time during the flight to get them to their destination close to the original arrival time. This is commonly referred to as “gain” and we will create this variable using the mutate() function. flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay) Let’s take a look at dep_delay, arr_delay, and the resulting gain variables for the first 5 rows in our new flights data frame: # A tibble: 5 x 3 dep_delay arr_delay gain &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2 11 -9 2 4 20 -16 3 2 33 -31 4 -1 -18 17 5 -6 -25 19 The flight in the first row departed 2 minutes late but arrived 11 minutes late, so its “gained time in the air” is actually a loss of 9 minutes, hence its gain is -9. Contrast this to the flight in the fourth row which departed a minute early (dep_delay of -1) but arrived 18 minutes early (arr_delay of -18), so its “gained time in the air” is 17 minutes, hence its gain is +17. Let’s look at summary measures of this gain variable and even plot it in the form of a histogram: gain_summary &lt;- flights %&gt;% summarize( min = min(gain, na.rm = TRUE), q1 = quantile(gain, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), median = quantile(gain, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE), q3 = quantile(gain, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), max = max(gain, na.rm = TRUE), mean = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(gain, na.rm = TRUE), missing = sum(is.na(gain)) ) gain_summary min q1 median q3 max mean sd missing -196 -3 7 17 109 5.66 18 9430 We’ve recreated the summary function we saw in Chapter 3 here using the summarize function in dplyr. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = gain)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) FIGURE 4.6: Histogram of gain variable We can also create multiple columns at once and even refer to columns that were just created in a new column. Hadley and Garrett produce one such example in Chapter 5 of “R for Data Science” (Grolemund and Wickham 2016): flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% mutate( gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, hours = air_time / 60, gain_per_hour = gain / hours ) Learning check (LC4.10) What do positive values of the gain variable in flights correspond to? What about negative values? And what about a zero value? (LC4.11) Could we create the dep_delay and arr_delay columns by simply subtracting dep_time from sched_dep_time and similarly for arrivals? Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in flights. (LC4.12) What can we say about the distribution of gain? Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the gain_summary data frame values. 4.6 arrange and sort rows One of the most common tasks people working with data would like to perform is sort the data frame’s rows in alphanumeric order of the values in a variable/column. For example, when calculating a median by hand requires you to first sort the data from the smallest to highest in value and then identify the “middle” value. The dplyr package has a function called arrange() that we will use to sort/reorder a data frame’s rows according to the values of the specified variable. This is often used after we have used the group_by() and summarize() functions as we will see. Let’s suppose we were interested in determining the most frequent destination airports for all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013: freq_dest &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% summarize(num_flights = n()) freq_dest # A tibble: 105 x 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 ABQ 254 2 ACK 265 3 ALB 439 4 ANC 8 5 ATL 17215 6 AUS 2439 7 AVL 275 8 BDL 443 9 BGR 375 10 BHM 297 # … with 95 more rows Observe that by default the rows of the resulting freq_dest data frame are sorted in alphabetical order of dest destination. Say instead we would like to see the same data, but sorted from the most to the least number of flights num_flights instead: freq_dest %&gt;% arrange(num_flights) # A tibble: 105 x 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 LEX 1 2 LGA 1 3 ANC 8 4 SBN 10 5 HDN 15 6 MTJ 15 7 EYW 17 8 PSP 19 9 JAC 25 10 BZN 36 # … with 95 more rows This is actually giving us the opposite of what we are looking for: the rows are sorted with the least frequent destination airports displayed first. To switch the ordering to be descending instead of ascending we use the desc() function, which is short for “descending”: freq_dest %&gt;% arrange(desc(num_flights)) # A tibble: 105 x 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 ORD 17283 2 ATL 17215 3 LAX 16174 4 BOS 15508 5 MCO 14082 6 CLT 14064 7 SFO 13331 8 FLL 12055 9 MIA 11728 10 DCA 9705 # … with 95 more rows In other words, arrange() sorts in ascending order by default unless you override this default behavior by using desc(). 4.7 join data frames Another common data transformation task is “joining” or “merging” two different datasets. For example in the flights data frame the variable carrier lists the carrier code for the different flights. While the corresponding airline names for &quot;UA&quot; and &quot;AA&quot; might be somewhat easy to guess (United and American Airlines), what airlines have codes? &quot;VX&quot;, &quot;HA&quot;, and &quot;B6&quot;? This information is provided in a separate data frame airlines. View(airlines) We see that in airports, carrier is the carrier code while name is the full name of the airline company. Using this table, we can see that &quot;VX&quot;, &quot;HA&quot;, and &quot;B6&quot; correspond to Virgin America, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue respectively. However, wouldn’t it be nice to have all this information in a single data frame instead of two separate data frames? We can do this by “joining” i.e. “merging” the flights and airlines data frames. Note that the values in the variable carrier in the flights data frame match the values in the variable carrier in the airlines data frame. In this case, we can use the variable carrier as a key variable to match the rows of the two data frames. Key variables are almost always identification variables that uniquely identify the observational units as we saw in Subsection 2.4.4. This ensures that rows in both data frames are appropriately matched during the join. Hadley and Garrett (Grolemund and Wickham 2016) created the following diagram to help us understand how the different datasets are linked by various key variables: FIGURE 4.7: Data relationships in nycflights13 from R for Data Science 4.7.1 Matching “key” variable names In both the flights and airlines data frames, the key variable we want to join/merge/match the rows of the two data frames by have the same name: carriers. We make use of the inner_join() function to join the two data frames, where the rows will be matched by the variable carrier. flights_joined &lt;- flights %&gt;% inner_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(flights) View(flights_joined) Observe that the flights and flights_joined data frames are identical except that flights_joined has an additional variable name whose values correspond to the airline company names drawn from the airlines data frame. A visual representation of the inner_join() is given below (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). There are other types of joins available (such as left_join(), right_join(), outer_join(), and anti_join()), but the inner_join() will solve nearly all of the problems you’ll encounter in this book. FIGURE 4.8: Diagram of inner join from R for Data Science 4.7.2 Different “key” variable names Say instead you are interested in the destinations of all domestic flights departing NYC in 2013 and ask yourself: “What cities are these airports in?” “Is &quot;ORD&quot; Orlando?” &quot;Where is &quot;FLL&quot;? The airports data frame contains airport codes: View(airports) However, looking at both the airports and flights frames and the visual representation of the relations between these data frames in Figure 4.8 above, we see that in: the airports data frame the airport code is in the variable faa the flights data frame the airport codes are in the variables origin and dest So to join these two data frames so that we can identify the destination cities for example, our inner_join() operation will use the by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;) argument, which allows us to join two data frames where the key variable has a different name: flights_with_airport_names &lt;- flights %&gt;% inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) View(flights_with_airport_names) Let’s construct the sequence of commands that computes the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also includes information about each destination airport: named_dests &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% summarize(num_flights = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(num_flights)) %&gt;% inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) %&gt;% rename(airport_name = name) named_dests # A tibble: 101 x 9 dest num_flights airport_name lat lon alt tz dst tzone &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 ORD 17283 Chicago Ohare Intl 42.0 -87.9 668 -6 A America… 2 ATL 17215 Hartsfield Jackson… 33.6 -84.4 1026 -5 A America… 3 LAX 16174 Los Angeles Intl 33.9 -118. 126 -8 A America… 4 BOS 15508 General Edward Law… 42.4 -71.0 19 -5 A America… 5 MCO 14082 Orlando Intl 28.4 -81.3 96 -5 A America… 6 CLT 14064 Charlotte Douglas … 35.2 -80.9 748 -5 A America… 7 SFO 13331 San Francisco Intl 37.6 -122. 13 -8 A America… 8 FLL 12055 Fort Lauderdale Ho… 26.1 -80.2 9 -5 A America… 9 MIA 11728 Miami Intl 25.8 -80.3 8 -5 A America… 10 DCA 9705 Ronald Reagan Wash… 38.9 -77.0 15 -5 A America… # … with 91 more rows In case you didn’t know, &quot;ORD&quot; is the airport code of Chicago O’Hare airport and &quot;FLL&quot; is the main airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which we can now see in the airport_name variable in the resulting named_dests data frame. 4.7.3 Multiple “key” variables Say instead we are in a situation where we need to join by multiple variables. For example, in Figure 4.7 above we see that in order to join the flights and weather data frames, we need more than one key variable: year, month, day, hour, and origin. This is because the combination of these 5 variables act to uniquely identify each observational unit in the weather data frame: hourly weather recordings at each of the 3 NYC airports. We achieve this by specifying a vector of key variables to join by using the c() function for “combine” or “concatenate” that we saw earlier: flights_weather_joined &lt;- flights %&gt;% inner_join(weather, by = c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;origin&quot;)) View(flights_weather_joined) Learning check (LC4.13) Looking at Figure 4.7, when joining flights and weather (or, in other words, matching the hourly weather values with each flight), why do we need to join by all of year, month, day, hour, and origin, and not just hour? (LC4.14) What surprises you about the top 10 destinations from NYC in 2013? 4.7.4 Normal forms The data frames included in the nycflights13 package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data. For example, the flights data frame only saves the carrier code of the airline company; it does not include the actual name of the airline. For example the first row of flights has carrier equal to UA, but does it does not include the airline name “United Air Lines Inc.” The names of the airline companies are included in the name variable of the airlines data frame. In order to have the airline company name included in flights, we could join these two data frames as follows: joined_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% inner_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(joined_flights) We are capable of performing this join because each of the data frames have keys in common to relate one to another: the carrier variable in both the flights and airlines data frames. The key variable(s) that we join are often identification variables we mentioned previously. This is an important property of what’s known as normal forms of data. The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called normalization. More information is available on Wikipedia. Learning check (LC4.15) What are some advantages of data in normal forms? What are some disadvantages? 4.8 Other verbs Here are some other useful data wrangling verbs that might come in handy: select() only a subset of variables/columns rename() variables/columns to have new names Return only the top_n() values of a variable 4.8.1 select variables FIGURE 4.9: Select diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet We’ve seen that the flights data frame in the nycflights13 package contains 19 different variables. You can identify the names of these 19 variables by running the glimpse() function from the dplyr package: glimpse(flights) However, say you only need two of these variables, say carrier and flight. You can select() these two variables: flights %&gt;% select(carrier, flight) This function makes exploring data frames with a very large number of variables easier for humans to process by restricting consideration to only those we care about, like our example with carrier and flight above. This might make viewing the dataset using the View() spreadsheet viewer more digestible. However, as far as the computer is concerned, it doesn’t care how many additional variables are in the data frame in question, so long as carrier and flight are included. Let’s say instead you want to drop i.e deselect certain variables. For example, take the variable year in the flights data frame. This variable isn’t quite a “variable” in the sense that all the values are 2013 i.e. it doesn’t change. Say you want to remove the year variable from the data frame; we can deselect year by using the - sign: flights_no_year &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(-year) glimpse(flights_no_year) Another way of selecting columns/variables is by specifying a range of columns: flight_arr_times &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(month:day, arr_time:sched_arr_time) flight_arr_times The select() function can also be used to reorder columns in combination with the everything() helper function. Let’s suppose we’d like the hour, minute, and time_hour variables, which appear at the end of the flights dataset, to appear immediately after the year, month, and day variables while keeping the rest of the variables. In the code below everything() picks up all remaining variables. flights_reorder &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(year, month, day, hour, minute, time_hour, everything()) glimpse(flights_reorder) Lastly, the helper functions starts_with(), ends_with(), and contains() can be used to select variables/column that match those conditions. For example: flights_begin_a &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(starts_with(&quot;a&quot;)) flights_begin_a flights_delays &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(ends_with(&quot;delay&quot;)) flights_delays flights_time &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;time&quot;)) flights_time 4.8.2 rename variables Another useful function is rename(), which as you may have guessed renames one column to another name. Suppose we want dep_time and arr_time to be departure_time and arrival_time instead in the flights_time data frame: flights_time_new &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;time&quot;)) %&gt;% rename(departure_time = dep_time, arrival_time = arr_time) glimpse(flights_time) Note that in this case we used a single = sign within the rename(), for example departure_time = dep_time. This is because we are not testing for equality like we would using ==, but instead we want to assign a new variable departure_time to have the same values as dep_time and then delete the variable dep_time. It’s easy to forget if the new name comes before or after the equals sign. I usually remember this as “New Before, Old After” or NBOA. 4.8.3 top_n values of a variable We can also return the top n values of a variable using the top_n() function. For example, we can return a data frame of the top 10 destination airports using the example from Section 4.7.2. Observe that we set the number of values to return to n = 10 and wt = num_flights to indicate that we want the rows of corresponding to the top 10 values of num_flights. See the help file for top_n() by running ?top_n for more information. named_dests %&gt;% top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) Let’s further arrange() these results in descending order of num_flights: named_dests %&gt;% top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) %&gt;% arrange(desc(num_flights)) Learning check (LC4.16) What are some ways to select all three of the dest, air_time, and distance variables from flights? Give the code showing how to do this in at least three different ways. (LC4.17) How could one use starts_with, ends_with, and contains to select columns from the flights data frame? Provide three different examples in total: one for starts_with, one for ends_with, and one for contains. (LC4.18) Why might we want to use the select function on a data frame? (LC4.19) Create a new data frame that shows the top 5 airports with the largest arrival delays from NYC in 2013. 4.9 Conclusion 4.9.1 Summary table Let’s recap our data wrangling verbs in Table 4.1. Using these verbs and the pipe %&gt;% operator from Section 4.1, you’ll be able to write easily legible code to perform almost all the data wrangling necessary for the rest of this book. TABLE 4.1: Summary of data wrangling verbs Verb Data wrangling operation filter() Pick out a subset of rows summarize() Summarize many values to one using a summary statistic function like mean(), median(), etc. group_by() Add grouping structure to rows in data frame. Note this does not change values in data frame. mutate() Create new variables by mutating existing ones arrange() Arrange rows of a data variable in ascending (default) or descending order inner_join() Join/merge two data frames, matching rows by a key variable Learning check (LC4.20) Let’s now put your newly acquired data wrangling skills to the test! An airline industry measure of a passenger airline’s capacity is the available seat miles, which is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometers flown summed over all flights. So for example say an airline had 2 flights using a plane with 10 seats that flew 500 miles and 3 flights using a plane with 20 seats that flew 1000 miles, the available seat miles would be 2 \\(\\times\\) 10 \\(\\times\\) 500 \\(+\\) 3 \\(\\times\\) 20 \\(\\times\\) 1000 = 70,000 seat miles. Using the datasets included in the nycflights13 package, compute the available seat miles for each airline sorted in descending order. After completing all the necessary data wrangling steps, the resulting data frame should have 16 rows (one for each airline) and 2 columns (airline name and available seat miles). Here are some hints: Crucial: Unless you are very confident in what you are doing, it is worthwhile to not starting coding right away, but rather first sketch out on paper all the necessary data wrangling steps not using exact code, but rather high-level pseudocode that is informal yet detailed enough to articulate what you are doing. This way you won’t confuse what you are trying to do (the algorithm) with how you are going to do it (writing dplyr code). Take a close look at all the datasets using the View() function: flights, weather, planes, airports, and airlines to identify which variables are necessary to compute available seat miles. Figure 4.7 above showing how the various datasets can be joined will also be useful. Consider the data wrangling verbs in Table 4.1 as your toolbox! 4.9.2 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. If you want to further unlock the power of the dplyr package for data wrangling, we suggest you that you check out RStudio’s “Data Transformation with dplyr” cheatsheet. This cheatsheet summarizes much more than what we’ve discussed in this chapter, in particular more-intermediate level and advanced data wrangling functions, while providing quick and easy to read visual descriptions. You can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -&gt; Help -&gt; Cheatsheets -&gt; “Data Transformation with dplyr”: FIGURE 4.10: Data Transformation with dplyr cheatsheat On top of data wrangling verbs and examples we presented in this section, if you’d like to see more examples of using the dplyr package for data wrangling check out Chapter 5 of Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham’s and Garrett’s book (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). 4.9.3 What’s to come? So far in this book, we’ve explored, visualized, and wrangled data saved in data frames that are in spreadsheet-type format: rectangular with a certain number of rows corresponding to observations and a certain number of columns corresponding to variables describing the observations. We’ll see in Chapter 5 that there are actually two ways to represent data in spreadsheet-type rectangular format: 1) “wide” format and 2) “tall/narrow” format also known in R circles as “tidy” format. While the distinction between “tidy” and non-“tidy” formatted data is very subtle, it has very large implications for whether or not we can use the ggplot2 package for data visualization and the dplyr package for data wrangling. Furthermore, we’ve only explored, visualized, and wrangled data saved within R packages. What if you have spreadsheet data saved in a Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or “Comma-Separated Values” (CSV) file that you would like to analyze? In Chapter 5, we’ll show you how to import this data into R using the readr package. References "],

In Section 2.4, we started exploring our first data frame: the flights data frame included in the nycflights13 package. In Chapter 3 we created visualizations based on the data included in flights and other data frames such as weather. In Chapter 4, we learned how to wrangle data, in other words take existing data frames and transform/ modify them to suit our analysis goals. In this final chapter of the “Data Science via the tidyverse” portion of the book, we extend some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called “tidy” data. You will see that having data stored in “tidy” format is about more than what the colloquial definition of the term “tidy” might suggest: having your data “neatly organized.” Instead, we define the term “tidy” in a more rigorous fashion, outlining a set of rules by which data can be stored, and the implications of these rules for analyses. Although knowledge of this type of data formatting was not necessary for our treatment of data visualization in Chapter 3 and data wrangling in Chapter 4 since all the data was already in “tidy” format, we’ll now see this format is actually essential to using the tools we covered in these two chapters. Furthermore, it will also be useful for all subsequent chapters in this book when we cover regression and statistical inference. First however, we’ll show you how to import spreadsheet data for use in R. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(nycflights13) library(fivethirtyeight) 5.1 Importing data Up to this point, we’ve almost entirely used data stored inside of an R package. Say instead you have your own data saved on your computer or somewhere online? How can you analyze this data in R? Spreadsheet data is often saved in one of the following formats: A Comma Separated Values .csv file. You can think of a .csv file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where: Each line in the file corresponds to one row of data/one observation. Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas. The first line is often, but not always, a header row indicating the names of the columns/variables. An Excel .xlsx file. This format is based on Microsoft’s proprietary Excel software. As opposed to a bare-bones .csv files, .xlsx Excel files contain a lot of meta-data, or put more simply, data about the data. (Recall we saw a previous example of meta-data in Section 4.4 when adding “group structure” meta-data to a data frame by using the group_by() verb.) Some examples of spreadsheet meta-data include the use of bold and italic fonts, colored cells, different column widths, and formula macros. A Google Sheets file, which is a “cloud” or online-based way to work with a spreadsheet. Google Sheets allows you to download your data in both comma separated values .csv and Excel .xlsx formats however: go to the Google Sheets menu bar -&gt; File -&gt; Download as -&gt; Select “Microsoft Excel” or “Comma-separated values.” We’ll cover two methods for importing .csv and .xlsx spreadsheet data in R: one using the R console and the other using RStudio’s graphical user interface, abbreviated a GUI. 5.1.1 Using the console First, let’s import a Comma Separated Values .csv file of data directly off the internet. The .csv file dem_score.csv accessible at https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv contains ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992. Let’s use the read_csv() function from the readr package to read it off the web, import it into R, and save it in a data frame called dem_score library(readr) dem_score &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv&quot;) dem_score # A tibble: 96 x 10 country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982` `1987` `1992` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Albania -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 5 2 Argentina -9 -1 -1 -9 -9 -9 -8 8 7 3 Armenia -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 7 4 Australia 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 5 Austria 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 6 Azerbaijan -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 1 7 Belarus -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 7 8 Belgium 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 Bhutan -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 10 Bolivia -4 -3 -3 -4 -7 -7 8 9 9 # … with 86 more rows In this dem_score data frame, the minimum value of -10 corresponds to a highly autocratic nation whereas a value of 10 corresponds to a highly democratic nation. We’ll revisit the dem_score data frame in a case study in the upcoming Section 5.3. Note that the read_csv() function included in the readr package is different than the read.csv() function that comes installed with R by default. While the difference in the names might seem near meaningless (an _ instead of a .), the read_csv() function is in our opinion easier to use since it can more easily read data off the web and generally imports data at a much faster speed. 5.1.2 Using RStudio’s interface Let’s read in the exact same data saved in Excel format, but this time via RStudio’s graphical interface instead of via the R console. First download the Excel file dem_score.xlsx by clicking here, then Go to the Files panel of RStudio. Navigate to the directory i.e. folder on your computer where the downloaded dem_score.xlsx Excel file is saved. Click on dem_score.xlsx. Click “Import Dataset…” At this point you should see an image like this: After clicking on the “Import” button on the bottom right RStudio, RStudio will save this spreadsheet’s data in a data frame called dem_score and display its contents in the spreadsheet viewer. Furthermore, note in the bottom right of the above image there exists a “Code Preview”: you can copy and paste this code to reload your data again later automatically instead of repeating the above manual point-and-click process. 5.2 Tidy data Let’s now switch gears and learn about the concept of “tidy” data format by starting with a motivating example. Let’s consider the drinks data frame included in the fivethirtyeight data. Run the following: drinks # A tibble: 193 x 5 country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pur… &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 0 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 6 Antigua &amp; B… 102 128 45 4.9 7 Argentina 193 25 221 8.3 8 Armenia 21 179 11 3.8 9 Australia 261 72 212 10.4 10 Austria 279 75 191 9.7 # … with 183 more rows After reading the help file by running ?drinks, we see that drinks is a data frame containing results from a survey of the average number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed for 193 countries. This data was originally reported on the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com in Mona Chalabi’s article “Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?” Let’s apply some of the data wrangling verbs we learned in Chapter 4 on the drinks data frame. Let’s filter() the drinks data frame to only consider 4 countries (the United States, China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia) then select() all columns except total_litres_of_pure_alcohol by using - sign, then rename() the variables beer_servings, spirit_servings, and wine_servings to beer, spirit, and wine respectively and save the resulting data frame in drinks_smaller. drinks_smaller &lt;- drinks %&gt;% filter(country %in% c(&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;, &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot;)) %&gt;% select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) %&gt;% rename(beer = beer_servings, spirit = spirit_servings, wine = wine_servings) drinks_smaller # A tibble: 4 x 4 country beer spirit wine &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China 79 192 8 2 Italy 85 42 237 3 Saudi Arabia 0 5 0 4 USA 249 158 84 Using the drinks_smaller data frame, how would we create the side-by-side AKA dodged barplot in Figure 5.1? Recall we saw barplots displaying two categorical variables in Section 3.8.3. FIGURE 5.1: Alcohol consumption in 4 countries. Let’s break down the Grammar of Graphics: The categorical variable country with four levels (China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, USA) would have to be mapped to the x-position of the bars. The numerical variable servings would have to be mapped to the y-position of the bars, in other words the height of the bars. The categorical variable type with three levels (beer, spirit, wine) who have to be mapped to the fill color of the bars. Observe however that drinks_smaller has three separate variables for beer, spirit, and wine, whereas in order to recreate the side-by-side AKA dodged barplot in Figure 5.1 we would need a single variable type with three possible values: beer, spirit, and wine, which we would then map to the fill aesthetic. In other words, for us to be able to create the barplot in Figure 5.1, our data frame would have to look like this: drinks_smaller_tidy # A tibble: 12 x 3 country type servings &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China beer 79 2 Italy beer 85 3 Saudi Arabia beer 0 4 USA beer 249 5 China spirit 192 6 Italy spirit 42 7 Saudi Arabia spirit 5 8 USA spirit 158 9 China wine 8 10 Italy wine 237 11 Saudi Arabia wine 0 12 USA wine 84 Let’s compare the drinks_smaller_tidy with the drinks_smaller data frame from earlier: drinks_smaller # A tibble: 4 x 4 country beer spirit wine &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China 79 192 8 2 Italy 85 42 237 3 Saudi Arabia 0 5 0 4 USA 249 158 84 Observe that while drinks_smaller and drinks_smaller_tidy are both rectangular in shape and contain the same 12 numerical values (3 alcohol types \\(\\times\\) 4 countries), they are formatted differently. drinks_smaller is formatted in what’s known as “wide” format, whereas drinks_smaller_tidy is formatted in what’s known as “long/narrow”. In the context of using R, long/narrow format is also known as “tidy” format. Furthermore, in order to use the ggplot2 and dplyr packages for data visualization and data wrangling, your input data frames must be in “tidy” format. So all non-“tidy” data must be converted to “tidy” format first. Before we show you how to convert non-“tidy” data frames like drinks_smaller to “tidy” data frames like drinks_smaller_tidy, let’s go over the explicit definition of “tidy” data. 5.2.1 Definition of “tidy” data You have surely heard the word “tidy” in your life: “Tidy up your room!” “Please write your homework in a tidy way so that it is easier to grade and to provide feedback.” Marie Kondo’s best-selling book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing and Netflix TV series Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. “I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - ‘Read me, please!’” - Linda Grant What does it mean for your data to be “tidy”? While “tidy” has a clear English meaning of “organized”, “tidy” in the context of data science using R means that your data follows a standardized format. We will follow Hadley Wickham’s definition of tidy data here (Wickham 2014): A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings AKA text data (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes. Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table. FIGURE 5.2: Tidy data graphic from R for Data Science. For example, say you have the following table of stock prices in Table 5.1: TABLE 5.1: Stock Prices (Non-Tidy Format) Date Boeing Stock Price Amazon Stock Price Google Stock Price 2009-01-01 $173.55 $174.90 $174.34 2009-01-02 $172.61 $171.42 $170.04 Although the data are neatly organized in a rectangular spreadsheet-type format, they are not in tidy format because while there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (Date, Stock Name, and Stock Price), there are not three columns. In “tidy” data format each variable should be its own column, as shown in Table 5.2. Notice that both tables present the same information, but in different formats. TABLE 5.2: Stock Prices (Tidy Format) Date Stock Name Stock Price 2009-01-01 Boeing $173.55 2009-01-02 Boeing $172.61 2009-01-01 Amazon $174.90 2009-01-02 Amazon $171.42 2009-01-01 Google $174.34 2009-01-02 Google $170.04 Now we have the requisite three columns Date, Stock Name, and Stock Price. On the other hand, consider the data in Table 5.3. TABLE 5.3: Date, Boeing Price, Weather Data Date Boeing Price Weather 2009-01-01 $173.55 Sunny 2009-01-02 $172.61 Overcast In this case, even though the variable “Boeing Price” occurs just like in our non-“tidy” data in Table 5.1, the data is “tidy” since there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information: Date, Boeing stock price, and the weather that particular day. Learning check (LC5.1) What are common characteristics of “tidy” data frames? (LC5.2) What makes “tidy” data frames useful for organizing data? 5.2.2 Converting to “tidy” data In this book so far, you’ve only seen data frames that were already in “tidy” format. Furthermore for the rest of this book, you’ll mostly only see data frames that are already in “tidy” format as well. This is not always the case however with data in the wild. If your original data frame is in wide i.e. non-“tidy” format and you would like to use the ggplot2 package for data visualization or the dplyr package for data wrangling, you will first have to convert it “tidy” format using the gather() function in the tidyr package (Wickham and Henry 2019). Going back to our drinks_smaller data frame from earlier: drinks_smaller # A tibble: 4 x 4 country beer spirit wine &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China 79 192 8 2 Italy 85 42 237 3 Saudi Arabia 0 5 0 4 USA 249 158 84 We convert it to “tidy” format by using the gather() function from the tidyr package as follows: drinks_smaller_tidy &lt;- drinks_smaller %&gt;% gather(key = type, value = servings, -country) drinks_smaller_tidy # A tibble: 12 x 3 country type servings &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China beer 79 2 Italy beer 85 3 Saudi Arabia beer 0 4 USA beer 249 5 China spirit 192 6 Italy spirit 42 7 Saudi Arabia spirit 5 8 USA spirit 158 9 China wine 8 10 Italy wine 237 11 Saudi Arabia wine 0 12 USA wine 84 We set the arguments to gather() as follows: key is the name of the column/variable in the new “tidy” frame that contains the column names of the original data frame that you want to tidy. Observe how we set key = type and in the resulting drinks_smaller_tidy the column type contains the three types of alcohol beer, spirit, and wine. value is the name of the column/variable in the “tidy” frame that contains the rows and columns of values in the original data frame you want to tidy. Observe how we set value = servings and in the resulting drinks_smaller_tidy the column value contains the 4 \\(\\times\\) 3 = 12 numerical values. The third argument are the columns you either want to or don’t want to tidy. Observe how we set this to -country indicating that we don’t want to tidy the country variable in drinks_smaller and rather only beer, spirit, and wine. The third argument is a little nuanced, so let’s consider another example. Note the code below is very similar, but now the third argument species which columns we’d want to tidy c(beer, spirit, wine), instead of the columns we don’t want to tidy -country. Note the use of c() to create a vector of the columns in drinks_smaller that we’d like to tidy. If you run the code below, you’ll see that the resulting drinks_smaller_tidy is the same. drinks_smaller_tidy &lt;- drinks_smaller %&gt;% gather(key = type, value = servings, c(beer, spirit, wine)) drinks_smaller_tidy With our drinks_smaller_tidy “tidy” format data frame, we can now produce a side-by-side AKA dodged barplot using geom_col() and not geom_bar(), since we would like to map the servings variable to the y-aesthetic of the bars. ggplot(drinks_smaller_tidy, aes(x=country, y=servings, fill=type)) + geom_col(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) Converting “wide” format data to “tidy” format often confuses new R users. The only way to learn to get comfortable with the gather() function is with practice, practice, and more practice. For example, see the examples in the bottom of the help file for gather() by running ?gather. We’ll show another example of using gather() to convert a “wide” formatted data frame to “tidy” format in Section 5.3. For other examples of converting a dataset into “tidy” format, check out the different functions available for data tidying and a case study using data from the World Health Organization in R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). Learning check (LC5.3) Take a look the airline_safety data frame included in the fivethirtyeight data. Run the following: airline_safety After reading the help file by running ?airline_safety, we see that airline_safety is a data frame containing information on different airlines companies’ safety records. This data was originally reported on the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com in Nate Silver’s article “Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?”. Let’s ignore the incl_reg_subsidiaries and avail_seat_km_per_week variables for simplicity: airline_safety_smaller &lt;- airline_safety %&gt;% select(-c(incl_reg_subsidiaries, avail_seat_km_per_week)) airline_safety_smaller # A tibble: 56 x 7 airline incidents_85_99 fatal_accidents… fatalities_85_99 incidents_00_14 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 Aer Li… 2 0 0 0 2 Aerofl… 76 14 128 6 3 Aeroli… 6 0 0 1 4 Aerome… 3 1 64 5 5 Air Ca… 2 0 0 2 6 Air Fr… 14 4 79 6 7 Air In… 2 1 329 4 8 Air Ne… 3 0 0 5 9 Alaska… 5 0 0 5 10 Alital… 7 2 50 4 # … with 46 more rows, and 2 more variables: fatal_accidents_00_14 &lt;int&gt;, # fatalities_00_14 &lt;int&gt; This data frame is not in “tidy” format. How would you convert this data frame to be in “tidy” format, in particular so that it has a variable incident_type_years indicating the incident type/year and a variable count of the counts? 5.2.3 nycflights13 package Recall the nycflights13 package with data about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013 that we introduced in Section 2.4 and used extensively in Chapter 3 on data visualization and Chapter 4 on data wrangling. Let’s revisit the flights data frame by running View(flights). We saw that flights has a rectangular shape with each of its 336,776 rows corresponding to a flight and each of its 22 columns corresponding to different characteristics/measurements of each flight. This matches exactly with our definition of “tidy” data from above. Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. But what about the third property of “tidy” data? Each type of observational unit forms a table. Recall that we also saw in Section 2.4.3 that the observational unit for the flights data frame is an individual flight. In other words, the rows of the flights data frame refer to characteristics/measurements of individual flights. Also included in the nycflights13 package are other data frames with their rows representing different observational units (Wickham 2018): airlines: translation between two letter IATA carrier codes and names (16 in total). i.e. the observational unit is an airline company. planes: construction information about each of 3,322 planes used. i.e. the observational unit is an aircraft. weather: hourly meteorological data (about 8705 observations) for each of the three NYC airports. i.e. the observational unit is an hourly measurement. airports: airport names and locations. i.e. the observational unit is an airport. The organization of the information into these five data frames follow the third “tidy” data property: observations corresponding to the same observational unit should be saved in the same table i.e. data frame. You could think of this property as the old English expression: “birds of a feather flock together.” 5.3 Case study: Democracy in Guatemala In this section, we’ll show you another example of how to convert a data frame that isn’t in “tidy” format i.e. “wide” format, to a data frame that is in “tidy” format i.e. “long/narrow” format. We’ll do this using the gather() function from the tidyr package again. Furthermore, we’ll make use of some of the ggplot2 data visualization and dplyr data wrangling tools you learned in Chapters 3 and 4. Let’s use the dem_score data frame we imported in Section 5.1, but focus on only data corresponding to Guatemala. guat_dem &lt;- dem_score %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;Guatemala&quot;) guat_dem # A tibble: 1 x 10 country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982` `1987` `1992` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Guatemala 2 -6 -5 3 1 -3 -7 3 3 Now let’s produce a time-series plot showing how the democracy scores have changed over the 40 years from 1952 to 1992 for Guatemala. Recall that we saw time-series plot in Section 3.4 on creating linegraphs using geom_line(). Let’s lay out the Grammar of Graphics we saw in Section 3.1. First we know we need to set data = guat_dem and use a geom_line() layer, but what is the aesthetic mapping of variables. We’d like to see how the democracy score has changed over the years, so we need to map: year to the x-position aesthetic and democracy_score to the y-position aesthetic Now we are stuck in a predicament, much like with our drinks_smaller example in Section 5.2. We see that we have a variable named country, but its only value is &quot;Guatemala&quot;. We have other variables denoted by different year values. Unfortunately, the guat_dem data frame is not “tidy” and hence is not in the appropriate format to apply the Grammar of Graphics and thus we cannot use the ggplot2 package. We need to take the values of the columns corresponding to years in guat_dem and convert them into a new “key” variable called year. Furthermore, we’d like to take the democracy scores on the inside of the table and turn them into a new “value” variable called democracy_score. Our resulting data frame will thus have three columns: country, year, and democracy_score. Recall that the gather() function in the tidyr package can complete this task for us: guat_dem_tidy &lt;- guat_dem %&gt;% gather(key = year, value = democracy_score, -country) guat_dem_tidy # A tibble: 9 x 3 country year democracy_score &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Guatemala 1952 2 2 Guatemala 1957 -6 3 Guatemala 1962 -5 4 Guatemala 1967 3 5 Guatemala 1972 1 6 Guatemala 1977 -3 7 Guatemala 1982 -7 8 Guatemala 1987 3 9 Guatemala 1992 3 We set the arguments to gather() as follows: key is the name of the column/variable in the new “tidy” frame that contains the column names of the original data frame that you want to tidy. Observe how we set key = year and in the resulting guat_dem_tidy the column year contains the years where the Guatemala’s democracy score were measured. value is the name of the column/variable in the “tidy” frame that contains the rows and columns of values in the original data frame you want to tidy. Observe how we set value = democracy_score and in the resulting guat_dem_tidy the column democracy_score contains the 1 \\(\\times\\) 9 = 9 democracy scores. The third argument are the columns you either want to or don’t want to tidy. Observe how we set this to -country indicating that we don’t want to tidy the country variable in guat_dem and rather only 1952 through 1992. However, observe in the output for guat_dem_tidy that the year variable is of type chr or character. Before we can plot this variable on the x-axis, we need to convert it into a numerical variable using the as.numeric() function within the mutate() function, which we saw in Section 4.5 on mutating existing variables to create new ones. guat_dem_tidy &lt;- guat_dem_tidy %&gt;% mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) We can now create the plot to show how the democracy score of Guatemala changed from 1952 to 1992 using a geom_line(): ggplot(guat_dem_tidy, aes(x = year, y = democracy_score)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Democracy Score&quot;, title = &quot;Democracy score in Guatemala 1952-1992&quot;) Learning check (LC5.4) Convert the dem_score data frame into a tidy data frame and assign the name of dem_score_tidy to the resulting long-formatted data frame.

The tidyverse package acts as an “umbrella” package whereby installing/loading it will install/load multiple packages at once for you. So after installing the tidyverse package as you would a normal package, running this: library(tidyverse) would be the same as running this: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(readr) library(purrr) library(tibble) library(stringr) library(forcats) You’ve seen the first 4 of the these packages: ggplot2 for data visualization, dplyr for data wrangling, tidyr for converting data to “tidy” format, and readr for importing spreadsheet data into R. The remaining packages (purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats) are left for a more advanced book; check out R for Data Science to learn about these packages. The tidyverse “umbrella” package gets its name from the fact that all functions in all its constituent packages are designed to that all inputs/argument data frames are in “tidy” format and all output data frames are in “tidy” format as well. This standardization of input and output data frames makes transitions between the various functions in these packages as seamless as possible. 5.4.2 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. If you want to learn more about using the readr and tidyr package, we suggest you that you check out RStudio’s “Data Import” cheatsheet. You can access this cheatsheet by going to RStudio’s cheatsheet page and searching for “Data Import Cheat Sheet”. FIGURE 5.3: Data Import cheatsheat 5.4.3 What’s to come? Congratulations! We’ve completed the “Data Science via the tidyverse” portion of this book! We’ll now move to the “data modeling” portion in Chapters 6 and 7, where you’ll leverage your data visualization and wrangling skills to model relationships between different variables in data frames. However, we’re going to leave the Chapter 11 on “Inference for Regression” until after we’ve covered statistical inference. FIGURE 5.4: ModernDive flowchart - On to Part II! References "],

The fundamental premise of data modeling is to make explicit the relationship between: an outcome variable \\(y\\), also called a dependent variable and an explanatory/predictor variable \\(x\\), also called an independent variable or covariate. Another way to state this is using mathematical terminology: we will model the outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of the explanatory/predictor variable \\(x\\). Why do we have two different labels, explanatory and predictor, for the variable \\(x\\)? That’s because roughly speaking data modeling can be used for two purposes: Modeling for prediction: You want to predict an outcome variable \\(y\\) based on the information contained in a set of predictor variables. You don’t care so much about understanding how all the variables relate and interact, but so long as you can make good predictions about \\(y\\), you’re fine. For example, if we know many individuals’ risk factors for lung cancer, such as smoking habits and age, can we predict whether or not they will develop lung cancer? Here we wouldn’t care so much about distinguishing the degree to which the different risk factors contribute to lung cancer, but instead only on whether or not they could be put together to make reliable predictions. Modeling for explanation: You want to explicitly describe the relationship between an outcome variable \\(y\\) and a set of explanatory variables, determine the significance of any found relationships, and have measures summarizing these. Continuing our example from above, we would now be interested in describing the individual effects of the different risk factors and quantifying the magnitude of these effects. One reason could be to design an intervention to reduce lung cancer cases in a population, such as targeting smokers of a specific age group with an advertisement for smoking cessation programs. In this book, we’ll focus more on this latter purpose. Data modeling is used in a wide variety of fields, including statistical inference, causal inference, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. There are many techniques for data modeling, such as tree-based models, neural networks and deep learning, and supervised learning. In this chapter, we’ll focus on one particular technique: linear regression, one of the most commonly-used and easy-to-understand approaches to modeling. Recall our discussion in Subsection 2.4.3 on numerical and categorical variables. Linear regression involves: an outcome variable \\(y\\) that is numerical and explanatory variables \\(\\vec{x}\\) that are either numerical or categorical. With linear regression there is always only one numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) but we have choices on both the number and the type of explanatory variables \\(\\vec{x}\\) to use. We’re going to cover the following regression scenarios: In this current chapter on basic regression, we’ll always have only one explanatory variable. In Section 6.1, this explanatory variable will be a single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\). This scenario is known as simple linear regression. In Section 6.2, this explanatory variable will be a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\). In the next chapter, Chapter 7 on multiple regression, we’ll have more than one explanatory variable: We’ll focus on two numerical explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in Section 7.1. This can be denoted as \\(\\vec{x}\\) as well since we have more than one explanatory variable. We’ll use one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable in Section 7.1. We’ll also introduce interaction models here; there, the effect of one explanatory variable depends on the value of another. We’ll study all four of these regression scenarios using real data, all easily accessible via R packages! Needed packages In this chapter we introduce a new package, moderndive, that is an accompaniment package to this ModernDive book. It includes useful functions for linear regression and other functions as well as data used later in the book. Let’s now load all the packages needed for this chapter. If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(gapminder) library(skimr) 6.1 One numerical explanatory variable Why do some professors and instructors at universities and colleges get high teaching evaluations from students while others don’t? What factors can explain these differences? Are there biases? These are questions that are of interest to university/college administrators, as teaching evaluations are among the many criteria considered in determining which professors and instructors should get promotions. Researchers at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas (UT Austin) tried to answer this question: what factors can explain differences in instructor’s teaching evaluation scores? To this end, they collected information on \\(n = 463\\) instructors. A full description of the study can be found at openintro.org. We’ll keep things simple for now and try to explain differences in instructor evaluation scores as a function of one numerical variable: their “beauty score.” The specifics on how this score was calculated will be described shortly. Could it be that instructors with higher beauty scores also have higher teaching evaluations? Could it be instead that instructors with higher beauty scores tend to have lower teaching evaluations? Or could it be there is no relationship between beauty score and teaching evaluations? We’ll achieve ways to address these questions by modeling the relationship between these two variables with a particular kind of linear regression called simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is the most basic form of linear regression. With it we have A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\). In this case, their teaching score. A single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\). In this case, their beauty score. 6.1.1 Exploratory data analysis A crucial step before doing any kind of modeling or analysis is performing an exploratory data analysis, or EDA, of all our data. Exploratory data analysis can give you a sense of the distribution of the data, and whether there are outliers and/or missing values. Most importantly, it can inform how to build your model. There are many approaches to exploratory data analysis; here are three: Most fundamentally: just looking at the raw values, in a spreadsheet for example. While this may seem trivial, many people ignore this crucial step! Computing summary statistics like means, medians, and standard deviations. Creating data visualizations. Let’s load the data, select only a subset of the variables, and look at the raw values. Recall you can look at the raw values by running View() in the console in RStudio to pop-up the spreadsheet viewer with the data frame of interest as the argument to View(). Here, however, we present only a snapshot of five randomly chosen rows: evals_ch6 &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, bty_avg, age) evals_ch6 %&gt;% sample_n(5) TABLE 6.1: Random sample of 5 instructors score bty_avg age 3.6 6.67 34 4.9 3.50 43 3.3 2.33 47 4.4 4.67 33 4.7 3.67 60 While a full description of each of these variables can be found at openintro.org, let’s summarize what each of these variables represents. score: Numerical variable of the average teaching score based on students’ evaluations between 1 and 5. This is the outcome variable \\(y\\) of interest. bty_avg: Numerical variable of average “beauty” rating based on a panel of 6 students’ scores between 1 and 10. This is the numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) of interest. Here 1 corresponds to a low beauty rating and 10 to a high beauty rating. age: A numerical variable of age in years as an integer value. Another way to look at the raw values is using the glimpse() function, which gives us a slightly different view of the data. We see Observations: 463, indicating that there are 463 observations in evals, each corresponding to a particular instructor at UT Austin. Expressed differently, each row in the data frame evals corresponds to one of 463 instructors. glimpse(evals_ch6) Observations: 463 Variables: 3 $ score &lt;dbl&gt; 4.7, 4.1, 3.9, 4.8, 4.6, 4.3, 2.8, 4.1, 3.4, 4.5, 3.8, 4.5, 4… $ bty_avg &lt;dbl&gt; 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.33, 3.33, 3.17, 3… $ age &lt;int&gt; 36, 36, 36, 36, 59, 59, 59, 51, 51, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 4… Since both the outcome variable score and the explanatory variable bty_avg are numerical, we can compute summary statistics about them such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. Let’s take evals_ch6 and select only the two variables of interest for now. However, let’s instead pipe this into the skim() function from the skimr package. This function quickly uses a “skim” of the data to return the following summary information about each variable. evals_ch6 %&gt;% select(score, bty_avg) %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 463 n variables: 2 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist bty_avg 0 463 463 4.42 1.53 1.67 3.17 4.33 5.5 8.17 ▂▅▅▇▃▃▂▁ score 0 463 463 4.17 0.54 2.3 3.8 4.3 4.6 5 ▁▁▂▃▅▇▇▆ In this case for our two numerical variables bty_avg beauty score and teaching score score it returns: missing: the number of missing values complete: the number of non-missing or complete values n: the total number of values mean: the average sd: the standard deviation p0: the 0th percentile: the value at which 0% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the minimum p25: the 25th percentile: the value at which 25% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the 1st quartile p50: the 50th percentile: the value at which 50% of observations are smaller than it. This is also know as the 2nd quartile and more commonly the median p75: the 75th percentile: the value at which 75% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the 3rd quartile p100: the 100th percentile: the value at which 100% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the maximum A quick snapshot of the histogram We get an idea of how the values in both variables are distributed. For example, the mean teaching score was 4.17 out of 5 whereas the mean beauty score was 4.42 out of 10. Furthermore, the middle 50% of teaching scores were between 3.80 and 4.6 (the first and third quartiles) while the middle 50% of beauty scores were between 3.17 and 5.5 out of 10. The skim() function however only returns what are called univariate summaries, i.e. summaries about single variables at a time. Since we are considering the relationship between two numerical variables, it would be nice to have a summary statistic that simultaneously considers both variables. The correlation coefficient is a bivariate summary statistic that fits this bill. Coefficients in general are quantitative expressions of a specific property of a phenomenon. A correlation coefficient is a quantitative expression between -1 and 1 that summarizes the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables: -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship: as the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go down. 0 indicates no relationship: the values of both variables go up/down independently of each other. +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship: as the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go up as well. Figure 6.1 gives examples of different correlation coefficient values for hypothetical numerical variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We see that while for a correlation coefficient of -0.75 there is still a negative relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), it is not as strong as the negative relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when the correlation coefficient is -1. FIGURE 6.1: Different correlation coefficients The correlation coefficient is computed using the get_correlation() function in the moderndive package, where in this case the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables from which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. We place the name of the response variable on the left hand side of the ~ and the explanatory variable on the right hand side of the “tilde.” We will use this same “formula” syntax with regression later in this chapter. evals_ch6 %&gt;% get_correlation(formula = score ~ bty_avg) # A tibble: 1 x 1 correlation &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.187 The correlation coefficient can also be computed using the cor() function, where in this case the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables from which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. Recall from Subsection 2.4.3 that the $ pulls out specific variables from a data frame: cor(x = evals_ch6$bty_avg, y = evals_ch6$score) [1] 0.187 In our case, the correlation coefficient of 0.187 indicates that the relationship between teaching evaluation score and beauty average is “weakly positive.” There is a certain amount of subjectivity in interpreting correlation coefficients, especially those that aren’t close to -1, 0, and 1. For help developing such intuition and more discussion on the correlation coefficient see Subsection 6.3.1 below. Let’s now proceed by visualizing this data. Since both the score and bty_avg variables are numerical, a scatterplot is an appropriate graph to visualize this data. Let’s do this using geom_point() and set informative axes labels and title and display the result in Figure 6.2. ggplot(evals_ch6, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of teaching and beauty scores&quot;) FIGURE 6.2: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin Observe the following: Most “beauty” scores lie between 2 and 8. Most teaching scores lie between 3 and 5. Recall our earlier computation of the correlation coefficient, which describes the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. Looking at Figure 6.3, it is not immediately apparent that these two variables are positively related. This is to be expected given the positive, but rather weak (close to 0), correlation coefficient of 0.187. Before we continue, we bring to light an important fact about this dataset: it suffers from overplotting. Recall from the data visualization Subsection 3.3.2 that overplotting occurs when several points are stacked directly on top of each other thereby obscuring the number of points. For example, let’s focus on the 6 points in the top-right of the plot with a beauty score of around 8 out of 10: are there truly only 6 points, or are there many more just stacked on top of each other? You can think of these as ties. Let’s break up these ties with a little random “jitter” added to the points in Figure 6.3. FIGURE 6.3: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin: Jittered Jittering adds a little random bump to each of the points to break up these ties: just enough so you can distinguish them, but not so much that the plot is overly altered. Furthermore, jittering is strictly a visualization tool; it does not alter the original values in the dataset. Let’s compare side-by-side the regular scatterplot in Figure 6.2 with the jittered scatterplot in Figure 6.3 in Figure 6.4. FIGURE 6.4: Comparing regular and jittered scatterplots. We make several further observations: Focusing our attention on the top-right of the plot again, as noted earlier where there seemed to only be 6 points in the regular scatterplot, we see there were in fact really 9 as seen in the jittered scatterplot. A further interesting trend is that the jittering revealed a large number of instructors with beauty scores of between 3 and 4.5, towards the lower end of the beauty scale. To keep things simple in this chapter, we’ll present regular scatterplots rather than the jittered scatterplots, though we’ll keep the overplotting in mind whenever looking at such plots. Going back to scatterplot in Figure 6.2, let’s improve on it by adding a “regression line” in Figure 6.5. This is easily done by adding a new layer to the ggplot code that created Figure 6.3: + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;). A regression line is a “best fitting” line in that of all possible lines you could draw on this plot, it is “best” in terms of some mathematical criteria. We discuss the criteria for “best” in Subsection 6.3.3 below, but we suggest you read this only after covering the concept of a residual coming up in Subsection 6.1.3. ggplot(evals_ch6, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of teaching and beauty scores&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) FIGURE 6.5: Regression line When viewed on this plot, the regression line is a visual summary of the relationship between two numerical variables, in our case the outcome variable score and the explanatory variable bty_avg. The positive slope of the blue line is consistent with our observed correlation coefficient of 0.187 suggesting that there is a positive relationship between score and bty_avg. We’ll see later however that while the correlation coefficient is not equal to the slope of this line, they always have the same sign: positive or negative. What are the grey bands surrounding the blue line? These are standard error bands, which can be thought of as error/uncertainty bands. Let’s skip this idea for now and suppress these grey bars by adding the argument se = FALSE to geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;). We’ll introduce standard errors in Chapter 8 on sampling, use them for constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests in Chapters 9 and 10, and consider them when we revisit regression in Chapter 11. ggplot(evals_ch6, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of teaching and beauty scores&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 6.6: Regression line without error bands Learning check (LC6.1) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same outcome variable \\(y\\) being score but with age as the new explanatory variable \\(x\\). Remember, this involves three things: Looking at the raw values. Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest. Creating informative visualizations. What can you say about the relationship between age and teaching scores based on this exploration? 6.1.2 Simple linear regression You may recall from secondary school / high school algebra, in general, the equation of a line is \\(y = a + bx\\), which is defined by two coefficients. Recall we defined this earlier as “quantitative expressions of a specific property of a phenomenon.” These two coefficients are: the intercept coefficient \\(a\\), or the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\), and the slope coefficient \\(b\\), or the increase in \\(y\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). However, when defining a line specifically for regression, like the blue regression line in Figure 6.6, we use slightly different notation: the equation of the regression line is \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\) where the intercept coefficient is \\(b_0\\), or the value of \\(\\widehat{y}\\) when \\(x=0\\), and the slope coefficient \\(b_1\\), or the increase in \\(\\widehat{y}\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). Why do we put a “hat” on top of the \\(y\\)? It’s a form of notation commonly used in regression, which we’ll introduce in the next Subsection 6.1.3 when we discuss fitted values. For now, let’s ignore the hat and treat the equation of the line as you would from secondary school / high school algebra recognizing the slope and the intercept. We know looking at Figure 6.6 that the slope coefficient corresponding to bty_avg should be positive. Why? Because as bty_avg increases, professors tend to roughly have larger teaching evaluation scores. However, what are the specific values of the intercept and slope coefficients? Let’s not worry about computing these by hand, but instead let the computer do the work for us. Specifically let’s use R! Let’s get the value of the intercept and slope coefficients by outputting something called the linear regression table. We will fit the linear regression model to the data using the lm() function and save this to score_model. lm stands for “linear model”, given that we are dealing with lines. When we say “fit”, we are saying find the best fitting line to this data. The lm() function that “fits” the linear regression model is typically used as lm(y ~ x, data = data_frame_name) where: y is the outcome variable, followed by a tilde (~). This is likely the key to the left of “1” on your keyboard. In our case, y is set to score. x is the explanatory variable. In our case, x is set to bty_avg. We call the combination y ~ x a model formula. Recall the use of this notation when we computed the correlation coefficient using the get_correlation() function in Subsection 6.1.1. data_frame_name is the name of the data frame that contains the variables y and x. In our case, data_frame_name is the evals_ch6 data frame. score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch6) score_model Call: lm(formula = score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch6) Coefficients: (Intercept) bty_avg 3.8803 0.0666 This output is telling us that the Intercept coefficient \\(b_0\\) of the regression line is 3.8803 and the slope coefficient for by_avg is 0.0666. Therefore the blue regression line in Figure 6.6 is \\[\\widehat{\\text{score}} = b_0 + b_{\\text{bty avg}} \\cdot\\text{bty avg} = 3.8803 + 0.0666\\cdot\\text{ bty avg}\\] where The intercept coefficient \\(b_0 = 3.8803\\) means for instructors that had a hypothetical beauty score of 0, we would expect them to have on average a teaching score of 3.8803. In this case however, while the intercept has a mathematical interpretation when defining the regression line, there is no practical interpretation since score is an average of a panel of 6 students’ ratings from 1 to 10, a bty_avg of 0 would be impossible. Furthermore, no instructors had a beauty score anywhere near 0 in this data. Of more interest is the slope coefficient associated with bty_avg: \\(b_{\\text{bty avg}} = +0.0666\\). This is a numerical quantity that summarizes the relationship between the outcome and explanatory variables. Note that the sign is positive, suggesting a positive relationship between beauty scores and teaching scores, meaning as beauty scores go up, so also do teaching scores go up. The slope’s precise interpretation is: For every increase of 1 unit in bty_avg, there is an associated increase of, on average, 0.0666 units of score. Such interpretations need be carefully worded: We only stated that there is an associated increase, and not necessarily a causal increase. For example, perhaps it’s not that beauty directly affects teaching scores, but instead individuals from wealthier backgrounds tend to have had better education and training, and hence have higher teaching scores, but these same individuals also have higher beauty scores. Avoiding such reasoning can be summarized by the adage “correlation is not necessarily causation.” In other words, just because two variables are correlated, it doesn’t mean one directly causes the other. We discuss these ideas more in Subsection 6.3.2. We say that this associated increase is on average 0.0666 units of teaching score and not that the associated increase is exactly 0.0666 units of score across all values of bty_avg. This is because the slope is the average increase across all points as shown by the regression line in Figure 6.6. Now that we’ve learned how to compute the equation for the blue regression line in Figure 6.6 and interpreted all its terms, let’s take our modeling one step further. This time after fitting the model using the lm(), let’s get something called the regression table using the get_regression_table() function from the moderndive package: # Fit regression model: score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch6) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(score_model) TABLE 6.2: Linear regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 Note how we took the output of the model fit saved in score_model and used it as an input to the subsequent get_regression_table() function. The output now looks like a table: in fact it is a data frame. The values of the intercept and slope of 3.880 and 0.0666 are now in the estimate column. But what are the remaining 5 columns: std_error, statistic, p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci? What do they tell us? They tell us about both the statistical significance and practical significance of our model results. You can think of this loosely as the “meaningfulness” of the results from a statistical perspective. We are going to put aside these ideas for now and revisit them in Chapter 11 on (statistical) inference for regression, after we’ve had a chance to cover: Standard errors in Chapter 8 (std_error) Confidence intervals in Chapter 9 (lower_ci and upper_ci) Hypothesis testing in Chapter 10 (statistic and p_value). For now, we’ll only focus on the term and estimate columns of any regression table. The get_regression_table() from the moderndive is an example of what’s known as a wrapper function in computer programming, which takes other pre-existing functions and “wraps” them into a single function. This concept is illustrated in Figure 6.7. FIGURE 6.7: The concept of a ‘wrapper’ function. So all you need to worry about is the what the inputs look like and what the outputs look like; you leave all the other details “under the hood of the car.” In our regression modeling example, the get_regression_table() has Input: A saved lm() linear regression Output: A data frame with information on the intercept and slope of the regression line. If you’re interested in learning more about the get_regression_table() function’s construction and thinking, see Subsection 6.3.4 below. Learning check (LC6.2) Fit a new simple linear regression using lm(score ~ age, data = evals_ch6) where age is the new explanatory variable \\(x\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above? 6.1.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals We just saw how to get the value of the intercept and the slope of the regression line from the regression table generated by get_regression_table(). Now instead, say we want information on individual points. In this case, we focus on one of the \\(n = 463\\) instructors in this dataset, corresponding to a single row of evals_ch6. For example, say we are interested in the 21st instructor in this dataset: TABLE 6.3: Data for 21st instructor score bty_avg age 4.9 7.33 31 What is the value on the blue line corresponding to this instructor’s bty_avg of 7.333? In Figure 6.8 we mark three values in particular corresponding to this instructor. Red circle: This is the observed value \\(y\\) = 4.9 and corresponds to this instructor’s actual teaching score. Red square: This is the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) and corresponds to the value on the regression line for \\(x\\) = 7.333. This value is computed using the intercept and slope in the regression table above: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x = 3.88 + 0.067 * 7.333 = 4.369\\] Blue arrow: The length of this arrow is the residual and is computed by subtracting the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) from the observed value \\(y\\). The residual can be thought of as the error or “lack of fit” of the regression line. In the case of this instructor, it is \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = 4.9 - 4.369 = 0.531. In other words, the model was off by 0.531 teaching score units for this instructor. FIGURE 6.8: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual What if we want both the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\) and the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) not only the 21st instructor but for all 463 instructors in the study? Recall that each instructor corresponds to one of the 463 rows in the evals_ch6 data frame and also one of the 463 points in the regression plot in Figure 6.6. We could repeat the above calculations by hand 463 times, but that would be tedious and time consuming. Instead, let’s use the get_regression_points() function that we’ve included in the moderndive R package. Note that in the table below we only present the results for the 21st through the 24th instructors. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(score_model) regression_points TABLE 6.4: Regression points (for only 21st through 24th instructor) ID score bty_avg score_hat residual 21 4.9 7.33 4.37 0.531 22 4.6 7.33 4.37 0.231 23 4.5 7.33 4.37 0.131 24 4.4 5.50 4.25 0.153 Just as with the get_regression_table() function, the inputs to the get_regression_points() function are the same, however the outputs are different. Let’s inspect the individual columns: The score column represents the observed value of the outcome variable \\(y\\). The bty_avg column represents the values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). The score_hat column represents the fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\). The residual column represents the residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\). get_regression_points() is another example of a wrapper function we described in Figure 6.7. If you’re curious about this function as well, check out Subsection 6.3.4. Just as we did for the 21st instructor in the evals_ch6 dataset (in the first row of the table above), let’s repeat the above calculations for the 24th instructor in the evals_ch6 dataset (in the fourth row of the table above): score = 4.4 is the observed value \\(y\\) for this instructor. bty_avg = 5.50 is the value of the explanatory variable \\(x\\) for this instructor. score_hat = 4.25 = 3.88 + 0.067 * \\(x\\) = 3.88 + 0.067 * 5.50 is the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) for this instructor. residual = 0.153 = 4.4 - 4.25 is the value of the residual for this instructor. In other words, the model was off by 0.153 teaching score units for this instructor. More development of this idea appears in Section 6.3.3 and we encourage you to read that section after you investigate residuals. 6.2 One categorical explanatory variable It’s an unfortunate truth that life expectancy is not the same across various countries in the world; there are a multitude of factors that are associated with how long people live. International development agencies are very interested in studying these differences in the hope of understanding where governments should allocate resources to address this problem. In this section, we’ll explore differences in life expectancy in two ways: Differences between continents: Are there significant differences in life expectancy, on average, between the five continents of the world: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania? Differences within continents: How does life expectancy vary within the world’s five continents? For example, is the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Africa larger than the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Asia? To answer such questions, we’ll study the gapminder dataset in the gapminder package. Recall we mentioned this dataset in Subsection 3.1.2 when we first studied the “Grammar of Graphics” introduced in Figure 3.1. This dataset has international development statistics such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country (\\(n\\) = 142) for 5-year intervals between 1952 and 2007. We’ll use this data for linear regression again, but note that our explanatory variable \\(x\\) is now categorical, and not numerical like when we covered simple linear regression in Section 6.1. More precisely, we have: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\). In this case, life expectancy. A single categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\), In this case, the continent the country is part of. When the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is categorical, the concept of a “best-fitting” line is a little different than the one we saw previously in Section 6.1 where the explanatory variable \\(x\\) was numerical. We’ll study these differences shortly in Subsection 6.2.2, but first we conduct our exploratory data analysis. 6.2.1 Exploratory data analysis Let’s load the gapminder data and filter() for only observations in 2007. Next we select() only the variables we’ll need along with gdpPercap, which is each country’s gross domestic product per capita (GDP). GDP is a rough measure of that country’s economic performance. (This will be used for the upcoming Learning Check). Lastly, we save this in a data frame with name gapminder2007: library(gapminder) gapminder2007 &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% filter(year == 2007) %&gt;% select(country, continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap) You should look at the raw data values both by bringing up RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer and the glimpse() function. In Table 6.5 we only show 5 randomly selected countries out of 142: View(gapminder2007) TABLE 6.5: Random sample of 5 countries country continent lifeExp gdpPercap Namibia Africa 52.9 4811 Portugal Europe 78.1 20510 Iran Asia 71.0 11606 Brazil Americas 72.4 9066 Italy Europe 80.5 28570 glimpse(gapminder2007) Observations: 142 Variables: 4 $ country &lt;fct&gt; Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Australia… $ continent &lt;fct&gt; Asia, Europe, Africa, Africa, Americas, Oceania, Europe, As… $ lifeExp &lt;dbl&gt; 43.8, 76.4, 72.3, 42.7, 75.3, 81.2, 79.8, 75.6, 64.1, 79.4,… $ gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt; 975, 5937, 6223, 4797, 12779, 34435, 36126, 29796, 1391, 33… We see that the variable continent is indeed categorical, as it is encoded as fct which stands for “factor.” This is R’s way of storing categorical variables. Let’s once again apply the skim() function from the skimr package to our two variables of interest: continent and lifeExp: gapminder2007 %&gt;% select(continent, lifeExp) %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 142 n variables: 2 ── Variable type:factor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── variable missing complete n n_unique top_counts continent 0 142 142 5 Afr: 52, Asi: 33, Eur: 30, Ame: 25 ordered FALSE ── Variable type:numeric ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 lifeExp 0 142 142 67.01 12.07 39.61 57.16 71.94 76.41 82.6 hist ▂▂▂▂▂▃▇▇ The output now reports summaries for categorical variables (the variable type: factor) separately from the numerical variables. For the categorical variable continent it now reports: missing, complete, n as before which are the number of missing, complete, and total number of values. n_unique: The unique number of levels to this variable, corresponding to Africa, Asia, Americas, Europe, and Oceania top_counts: In this case the top four counts: Africa has 52 entries each corresponding to a country, Asia has 33, Europe has 30, and Americans has 25. Not displayed is Oceania with 2 countries ordered: Reporting whether the variable is “ordinal.” In this case, it is not ordered. Given that the global median life expectancy is 71.94, half of the world’s countries (71 countries) will have a life expectancy less than 71.94. Further, half will have a life expectancy greater than this value. The mean life expectancy of 67.01 is lower however. Why are these two values different? Let’s look at a histogram of lifeExp in Figure 6.9 to see why. FIGURE 6.9: Histogram of Life Expectancy in 2007 We see that this data is left-skewed/negatively skewed: there are a few countries with very low life expectancy that are bringing down the mean life expectancy. However, the median is less sensitive to the effects of such outliers. Hence the median is greater than the mean in this case. Let’s proceed by comparing median and mean life expectancy between continents by adding a group_by(continent) to the above code: lifeExp_by_continent &lt;- gapminder2007 %&gt;% group_by(continent) %&gt;% summarize(median = median(lifeExp), mean = mean(lifeExp)) TABLE 6.6: Life expectancy by continent continent median mean Africa 52.9 54.8 Americas 72.9 73.6 Asia 72.4 70.7 Europe 78.6 77.6 Oceania 80.7 80.7 We see now that there are differences in life expectancy between the continents. For example let’s focus on only medians. While the median life expectancy across all \\(n = 142\\) countries in 2007 was 71.935, the median life expectancy across the \\(n =52\\) countries in Africa was only 52.927. Let’s create a corresponding visualization. One way to compare the life expectancy of countries in different continents would be via a faceted histogram. Recall we saw back in the Data Visualization chapter, specifically Section 3.6, that facets allow us to split a visualization by the different levels of a categorical variable or factor variable. In Figure 6.10, the variable we facet by is continent, which is categorical with five levels, each corresponding to the five continents of the world. ggplot(gapminder2007, aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Number of countries&quot;, title = &quot;Life expectancy by continent&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) FIGURE 6.10: Life expectancy in 2007 Another way would be via a geom_boxplot where we map the categorical variable continent to the \\(x\\)-axis and the different life expectancy within each continent on the \\(y\\)-axis; we do this in Figure 6.11. ggplot(gapminder2007, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Continent&quot;, y = &quot;Life expectancy (years)&quot;, title = &quot;Life expectancy by continent&quot;) FIGURE 6.11: Life expectancy in 2007 Some people prefer comparing a numerical variable between different levels of a categorical variable, in this case comparing life expectancy between different continents, using a boxplot over a faceted histogram as we can make quick comparisons with single horizontal lines. For example, we can see that even the country with the highest life expectancy in Africa is still lower than all countries in Oceania. It’s important to remember however that the solid lines in the middle of the boxes correspond to the medians (i.e. the middle value) rather than the mean (the average). So, for example, if you look at Asia, the solid line denotes the median life expectancy of around 72 years, indicating to us that half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy below 72 years whereas half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy above 72 years. Furthermore, note that: Africa and Asia have much more spread/variation in life expectancy as indicated by the interquartile range (the height of the boxes). Oceania has almost no spread/variation, but this might in large part be due to the fact there are only two countries in Oceania: Australia and New Zealand. Now, let’s start making comparisons of life expectancy between continents. Let’s use Africa as a baseline for comparison. Why Africa? Only because it happened to be first alphabetically, we could have just as appropriately used the Americas as the baseline for comparison. Using the “eyeball test” (just using our eyes to see if anything stands out), we make the following observations about differences in median life expectancy compared to the baseline of Africa: The median life expectancy of the Americas is roughly 20 years greater. The median life expectancy of Asia is roughly 20 years greater. The median life expectancy of Europe is roughly 25 years greater. The median life expectancy of Oceania is roughly 27.8 years greater. Let’s remember these four differences vs Africa corresponding to the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania: 20, 20, 25, 27.8. Learning check (LC6.3) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same explanatory variable \\(x\\) being continent but with gdpPercap as the new outcome variable \\(y\\). Remember, this involves three things: Looking at the raw values Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest. Creating informative visualizations What can you say about the differences in GDP per capita between continents based on this exploration? 6.2.2 Linear regression In Subsection 6.1.2 we introduced simple linear regression, which involves modeling the relationship between a numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of a numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\), in our life expectancy example, we now have a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) continent. While we still can fit a regression model, given our categorical explanatory variable we no longer have a concept of a “best-fitting” line, but rather “differences relative to a baseline for comparison.” Before we fit our regression model, let’s create a table similar to Table 6.6, but Report the mean life expectancy for each continent. Report the difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa’s mean life expectancy of 54.806 in the column “mean vs Africa”; this column is simply the “mean” column minus 54.806. Think back to your observations from the eyeball test of Figure 6.11 at the end of the last subsection. The column “mean vs Africa” is the same idea of comparing a summary statistic to a baseline for comparison, in this case the countries of Africa, but using means instead of medians. TABLE 6.7: Mean life expectancy by continent continent mean mean vs Africa Africa 54.8 0.0 Americas 73.6 18.8 Asia 70.7 15.9 Europe 77.6 22.8 Oceania 80.7 25.9 Now, let’s use the get_regression_table() function we introduced in Section 6.1.2 to get the regression table for gapminder2007 analysis: lifeExp_model &lt;- lm(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder2007) get_regression_table(lifeExp_model) TABLE 6.8: Linear regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 54.8 1.02 53.45 0 52.8 56.8 continentAmericas 18.8 1.80 10.45 0 15.2 22.4 continentAsia 15.9 1.65 9.68 0 12.7 19.2 continentEurope 22.8 1.70 13.47 0 19.5 26.2 continentOceania 25.9 5.33 4.86 0 15.4 36.5 Just as before, we have the term and estimates columns of interest, but unlike before, we now have 5 rows corresponding to 5 outputs in our table: an intercept like before, but also continentAmericas, continentAsia, continentEurope, and continentOceania. What are these values? First, we must describe the equation for fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\), which is a little more complicated when the \\(x\\) explanatory variable is categorical: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Amer}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Euro}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\\text{Ocean}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + 22.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x) \\end{align}\\] Let’s break this down. First, \\(\\mathbb{1}_{A}(x)\\) is what’s known in mathematics as an “indicator function” that takes one of two possible values: \\[ \\mathbb{1}_{A}(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x \\text{ is in } A \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. \\] In a statistical modeling context this is also known as a “dummy variable”. In our case, let’s consider the first such indicator variable: \\[ \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if } \\text{country } x \\text{ is in the Americas} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] Now let’s interpret the terms in the estimate column of the regression table. First \\(b_0 =\\) intercept = 54.8 corresponds to the mean life expectancy for countries in Africa, since for country \\(x\\) in Africa we have the following equation: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Amer}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Euro}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\\text{Ocean}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + 22.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\cdot 0 + 15.9\\cdot 0 + 22.8\\cdot 0 + 25.9\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 \\end{align}\\] i.e. All four of the indicator variables are equal to 0. Recall we stated earlier that we would treat Africa as the baseline for comparison group. Furthermore, this value corresponds to the group mean life expectancy for all African countries in Table 6.7. Next, \\(b_{\\text{Amer}}\\) = continentAmericas = 18.8 is the difference in mean life expectancy of countries in the Americas relative to Africa, or in other words, on average countries in the Americas had life expectancy 18.8 years greater. The fitted value yielded by this equation is: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Amer}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Euro}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\\text{Ocean}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + 22.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\cdot 1 + 15.9\\cdot 0 + 22.8\\cdot 0 + 25.9\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\\\ &amp;= 72.9 \\end{align}\\] i.e. in this case, only the indicator function \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x)\\) is equal to 1, but all others are 0. Recall that 72.9 corresponds to the group mean life expectancy for all countries in the Americas in Table 6.7. Similarly, \\(b_{\\text{Asia}}\\) = continentAsia = 15.9 is the difference in mean life expectancy of Asian countries relative to Africa countries, or in other words, on average countries in the Asia had life expectancy 18.8 years greater than Africa. The fitted value yielded by this equation is: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Amer}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Euro}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\\text{Ocean}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x) + 22.8\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 18.8\\cdot 0 + 15.9\\cdot 1 + 22.8\\cdot 0 + 25.9\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp;= 54.8 + 15.9\\\\ &amp;= 70.7 \\end{align}\\] i.e. in this case, only the indicator function \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{Asia}}(x)\\) is equal to 1, but all others are 0. Recall that 70.7 corresponds to the group mean life expectancy for all countries in Asia in Table 6.7. The same logic applies to \\(b_{\\text{Euro}} = 22.8\\) and \\(b_{\\text{Ocean}} = 25.9\\); they correspond to the “offset” in mean life expectancy for countries in Europe and Oceania, relative to the mean life expectancy of the baseline group for comparison of African countries. Let’s generalize this idea a bit. If we fit a linear regression model using a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) that has \\(k\\) levels, a regression model will return an intercept and \\(k - 1\\) “slope” coefficients. When \\(x\\) is a numerical explanatory variable the interpretation is of a “slope” coefficient, but when \\(x\\) is categorical the meaning is a little trickier. They are offsets relative to the baseline. In our case, since there are \\(k = 5\\) continents, the regression model returns an intercept corresponding to the baseline for comparison Africa and \\(k - 1 = 4\\) slope coefficients corresponding to the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Africa was chosen as the baseline by R for no other reason than it is first alphabetically of the 5 continents. You can manually specify which continent to use as baseline instead of the default choice of whichever comes first alphabetically, but we leave that to a more advanced course. (The forcats package is particularly nice for doing this and we encourage you to explore using it.) Learning check (LC6.4) Fit a new linear regression using lm(gdpPercap ~ continent, data = gapminder2007) where gdpPercap is the new outcome variable \\(y\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above? 6.2.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals Recall in Subsection 6.1.3 when we had a numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\), we defined: Observed values \\(y\\), or the observed value of the outcome variable Fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\), or the value on the regression line for a given \\(x\\) value Residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\), or the error between the observed value and the fitted value What do fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) and residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) correspond to when the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is categorical? Let’s investigate these values for the first 10 countries in the gapminder2007 dataset: TABLE 6.9: First 10 out of 142 countries country continent lifeExp gdpPercap Afghanistan Asia 43.8 975 Albania Europe 76.4 5937 Algeria Africa 72.3 6223 Angola Africa 42.7 4797 Argentina Americas 75.3 12779 Australia Oceania 81.2 34435 Austria Europe 79.8 36126 Bahrain Asia 75.6 29796 Bangladesh Asia 64.1 1391 Belgium Europe 79.4 33693 Recall the get_regression_points() function we used in Subsection 6.1.3 to return the observed value of the outcome variable, all explanatory variables, fitted values, and residuals for all points in the regression. Recall that each “point”. In this case, each row corresponds to one of 142 countries in the gapminder2007 dataset. They are also the 142 observations used to construct the boxplots in Figure 6.11. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(lifeExp_model) regression_points TABLE 6.10: Regression points (First 10 out of 142 countries) ID lifeExp continent lifeExp_hat residual 1 43.8 Asia 70.7 -26.900 2 76.4 Europe 77.6 -1.226 3 72.3 Africa 54.8 17.495 4 42.7 Africa 54.8 -12.075 5 75.3 Americas 73.6 1.712 6 81.2 Oceania 80.7 0.515 7 79.8 Europe 77.6 2.180 8 75.6 Asia 70.7 4.907 9 64.1 Asia 70.7 -6.666 10 79.4 Europe 77.6 1.792 Notice The fitted values lifeExp_hat \\(\\widehat{\\text{lifeexp}}\\). Countries in Africa have the same fitted value of 54.8, which is the mean life expectancy of Africa. Countries in Asia have the same fitted value of 70.7, which is the mean life expectancy of Asia. This similarly holds for countries in the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. The residual column is simply \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = lifeexp - lifeexp_hat. These values can be interpreted as that particular country’s deviation from the mean life expectancy of the respective continent’s mean. For example, the first row of this dataset corresponds to Afghanistan, and the residual of \\(-26.9 = 43.8 - 70.7\\) is Afghanistan’s mean life expectancy minus the mean life expectancy of all Asian countries. 6.3 Related topics 6.3.1 Correlation coefficient Let’s re-plot Figure 6.1, but now consider a broader range of correlation coefficient values in Figure 6.12. FIGURE 6.12: Different Correlation Coefficients As we suggested in Subsection 6.1.1, interpreting coefficients that are not close to the extreme values of -1 and 1 can be subjective. To develop your sense of correlation coefficients, we suggest you play the following 80’s-style video game called “Guess the correlation”! Click on the image below to do so: 6.3.2 Correlation is not necessarily causation You’ll note throughout this chapter we’ve been very cautious in making statements of the “associated effect” of explanatory variables on the outcome variables, for example our statement from Subsection 6.1.2 that “for every increase of 1 unit in bty_avg, there is an associated increase of, on average, 18.802 units of score.” We stay this because we are careful not to make causal statements. So while beauty score bty_avg is positively correlated with teaching score, does it directly cause effects on teaching score. For example, let’s say an instructor has their bty_avg reevaluated, but only after taking steps to try to boost their beauty score. Does this mean that they will suddenly be a better instructor? Or will they suddenly get higher teaching scores? Maybe? Here is another example, a not-so-great medical doctor goes through their medical records and finds that patients who slept with their shoes on tended to wake up more with headaches. So this doctor declares “Sleeping with shoes on cause headaches!” FIGURE 6.13: Does sleeping with shoes on cause headaches? However as some of you might have guessed, if someone is sleeping with their shoes on its probably because they are intoxicated. Furthermore, drinking more tends to cause more hangovers, and hence more headaches. In this instance, alcohol is what’s known as a confounding/lurking variable. It “lurks” behind the scenes, confounding or making less apparent, the causal effect (if any) of “sleeping with shoes on” with waking up with a headache. We can summarize this notion in Figure 6.14 with a causal graph where: Y: Is an outcome variable, here “waking up with a headache.” X: Is a treatment variable whose causal effect we are interested in, here “sleeping with shoes on.” FIGURE 6.14: Causal graph. So for example, many such studies use regression modeling where the outcome variable is set to Y and the explanatory/predictor variable is X, much as you’ve started learning how to do in this chapter. However, Figure 6.14 also includes a third variable with arrows pointing at both X and Y. Z: Is a confounding variable that affects both X &amp; Y, thus “confounding” their relationship. So as we said, alcohol will both cause people to be more likely to sleep with their shoes on as well as more likely to wake up with a headache. Thus when evaluating what causes one to wake up with a headache, its hard to tease out the effect of sleeping with shoes on versus just the alcohol. Thus our model needs to also use Z as an explanatory/predictor variable as well, in other words our doctor needs to take into account who had been drinking the night before. We’ll start covering multiple regression models that allows us to incorporate more than one variable in the next chapter. Establishing causation is a tricky problem and frequently takes either carefully designed experiments or methods to control for the effects of potential confounding variables. Both these approaches attempt either to remove all confounding variables or take them into account as best they can, and only focus on the behavior of an outcome variable in the presence of the levels of the other variable(s). Be careful as you read studies to make sure that the writers aren’t falling into this fallacy of correlation implying causation. If you spot one, you may want to send them a link to Spurious Correlations. 6.3.3 Best fitting line Regression lines are also known as “best fitting lines”. But what do we mean by best? Let’s unpack the criteria that is used by regression to determine best. Recall the plot in Figure 6.8 where for a instructor with a beauty average score of \\(x=7.333\\) The observed value \\(y=4.9\\) was marked with a red circle The fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = 4.369\\) on the regression line was marked with a red square The residual \\(y-\\widehat{y} = 4.9-4.369 = 0.531\\) was the length of the blue arrow. Let’s do this for another arbitrarily chosen instructor whose beauty score was \\(x=2.333\\). The residual in this case is \\(2.7 - 4.036 = -1.336\\). Another arbitrarily chosen instructor whose beauty score was \\(x=3.667\\) results in the residual in this case being \\(4.4 - 4.125 = 0.2753\\). Let’s do this one more time for another arbitrarily chosen instructor. This instructor had a beauty score of \\(x = 6\\). The residual in this case is \\(3.8 - 4.28 = -0.4802\\). Now let’s say we repeated this process for all 463 instructors in our dataset. Regression minimizes the sum of all 463 arrow lengths squared. In other words, it minimizes the sum of the squared residuals: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i)^2 \\] We square the arrow lengths so that positive and negative deviations of the same amount are treated equally. That’s why alternative names for the simple linear regression line are the least-squares line and the best fitting line. It can be proven via calculus and linear algebra that this line uniquely minimizes the sum of the squared arrow lengths. For the regression line in the plot, the sum of the squared residuals is 131.879. This is the lowest possible value of the sum of the squared residuals of all possible lines we could draw on this scatterplot? How do we know this? We can mathematically prove this fact, but this requires some calculus and linear algebra, so let’s leave this proof for another course! 6.3.4 get_regression_x() functions What is going on behind the scenes with the get_regression_table() get_regression_points() from the moderndive package? Recall we introduced In Subsection 6.1.2, the get_regression_table() function that returned a regression table. In Subsection 6.1.3, the get_regression_points() function that returned information on all \\(n\\) points/observations involved in a regression? and that these were examples of wrapper functions that takes other pre-existing functions and “wraps” them in a single function. This way all the user needs to worry about is the input and the output format, and ignore what’s “under the hood.” In this subsection we “lift the hood” and see how the engine of these wrapper functions work. First, the get_regression_table() wrapper function leverages the the tidy() function in the broom package and the clean_names() function in the janitor package to generate tidy data frames with information about a regression model. Here is what the regression table from Subsection 6.1.2 looks like: score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch6) get_regression_table(score_model) term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 The get_regression_table() function takes the above two functions that already existed in other R packages, uses them, and hides the details as seen below. This was on the editorial decision on our part as we felt the following code was unfortunately out of the reach for some new coders, so the following wrapper function was written so that users need only focus on the output. library(broom) library(janitor) score_model %&gt;% tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 3) %&gt;% clean_names() %&gt;% rename(lower_ci = conf_low, upper_ci = conf_high) term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci (Intercept) 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 Note that the mutate_if() function is from the dplyr package and applies the round() function with 3 significant digits precision only to those variables that are numerical. Similarly, the second get_regression_points() function is another wrapper function, but this time returning information about the points in a regression rather than the regression table. It uses the augment() function in the broom package instead of tidy() as with get_regression_points(). library(broom) library(janitor) score_model %&gt;% augment() %&gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 3) %&gt;% clean_names() %&gt;% select(-c(&quot;se_fit&quot;, &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;, &quot;cooksd&quot;, &quot;std_resid&quot;)) score bty_avg fitted resid 4.7 5.00 4.21 0.486 4.1 5.00 4.21 -0.114 3.9 5.00 4.21 -0.314 4.8 5.00 4.21 0.586 4.6 3.00 4.08 0.520 4.3 3.00 4.08 0.220 2.8 3.00 4.08 -1.280 4.1 3.33 4.10 -0.002 3.4 3.33 4.10 -0.702 4.5 3.17 4.09 0.409 In this case, it outputs only variables of interest to us as new regression modelers: the outcome variable \\(y\\) (score), all explanatory/predictor variables (bty_avg), all resulting fitted values \\(\\hat{y}\\) used by applying the equation of the regression line to bty_avg, and the residual \\(y - \\hat{y}\\). If you’re even more curious, take a look at the source code for these functions on GitHub. 6.4 Conclusion 6.4.1 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. 6.4.2 What’s to come? In this chapter, you’ve seen what we call “basic regression” when you only have one explanatory variable. In Chapter 7, we’ll study multiple regression where we have more than one explanatory variable! In particular, we’ll see why we’ve been conducting the residual analyses from Subsections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2. We are actually verifying some very important assumptions that must be met for the std_error (standard error), p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci (the end-points of the confidence intervals) columns in our regression tables to have valid interpretation. Again, don’t worry for now if you don’t understand what these terms mean. After the next chapter on multiple regression, we’ll dive in! "],
["7-multiple-regression.html", "Chapter 7 Multiple Regression 7.1 Two numerical explanatory variables 7.2 One numerical &amp; one categorical explanatory variable 7.3 Related topics 7.4 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Multiple Regression In Chapter 6 we introduced ideas related to modeling, in particular that the fundamental premise of modeling is to make explicit the relationship between an outcome variable \\(y\\) and an explanatory/predictor variable \\(x\\). Recall further the synonyms that we used to also denote \\(y\\) as the dependent variable and \\(x\\) as an independent variable or covariate. There are many modeling approaches one could take, among the most well-known being linear regression, which was the focus of the last chapter. Whereas in the last chapter we focused solely on regression scenarios where there is only one explanatory/predictor variable, in this chapter, we now focus on modeling scenarios where there is more than one. This case of regression more than one explanatory variable is known as multiple regression. You can imagine when trying to model a particular outcome variable, like teaching evaluation score as in Section 6.1 or life expectancy as in Section 6.2, it would be very useful to incorporate more than one explanatory variable. Since our regression models will now consider more than one explanatory/predictor variable, the interpretation of the associated effect of any one explanatory/predictor variables must be made in conjunction with the others. For example, say we are modeling individuals’ incomes as a function of their number of years of education and their parents’ wealth. When interpreting the effect of education on income, one has to consider the effect of their parents’ wealth at the same time, as these two variables are almost certainly related. Make note of this throughout this chapter and as you work on interpreting the results of multiple regression models into the future. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(ISLR) library(skimr) 7.1 Two numerical explanatory variables Let’s now attempt to identify factors that are associated with how much credit card debt an individual will have. The textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani is an intermediate-level textbook on statistical and machine learning freely available here. It has an accompanying R package called ISLR with datasets that the authors use to demonstrate various machine learning methods. One dataset that is frequently used by the authors is the Credit dataset where predictions are made on the credit card balance held by \\(n = 400\\) credit card holders. These predictions are based on information about them like income, credit limit, and education level. Note that this dataset is not based on actual individuals, it is a simulated dataset used for educational purposes. Since no information was provided as to who these \\(n\\) = 400 individuals are and how they came to be included in this dataset, it will be hard to make any scientific claims based on this data. Recall our discussion from the previous chapter that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. That being said, we’ll still use Credit to demonstrate multiple regression with: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\), in this case credit card balance. Two explanatory variables: A first numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\). In this case, their credit limit. A second numerical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\). In this case, their income (in thousands of dollars). In the forthcoming Learning Checks, we’ll consider a different scenario: The same numerical outcome variable \\(y\\): credit card balance. Two new explanatory variables: A first numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\): their credit rating. A second numerical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\): their age. 7.1.1 Exploratory data analysis Let’s load the Credit data and select() only the needed subset of variables. library(ISLR) Credit &lt;- Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Limit, Income, Rating, Age) Let’s look at the raw data values both by bringing up RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer and the glimpse() function. Although in Table 7.1 we only show 5 randomly selected credit card holders out of 400: View(Credit) TABLE 7.1: Random sample of 5 credit card holders Balance Limit Income Rating Age 98 1551 22.6 134 43 1677 11200 140.7 817 46 283 4270 36.9 299 63 50 3327 35.0 253 54 450 4442 30.4 316 30 glimpse(Credit) Observations: 400 Variables: 5 $ Balance &lt;int&gt; 333, 903, 580, 964, 331, 1151, 203, 872, 279, 1350, 1407, 0, … $ Limit &lt;int&gt; 3606, 6645, 7075, 9504, 4897, 8047, 3388, 7114, 3300, 6819, 8… $ Income &lt;dbl&gt; 14.9, 106.0, 104.6, 148.9, 55.9, 80.2, 21.0, 71.4, 15.1, 71.1… $ Rating &lt;int&gt; 283, 483, 514, 681, 357, 569, 259, 512, 266, 491, 589, 138, 3… $ Age &lt;int&gt; 34, 82, 71, 36, 68, 77, 37, 87, 66, 41, 30, 64, 57, 49, 75, 5… Let’s look at some summary statistics, again using the skim() function from the skimr package: Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Limit, Income) %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 400 n variables: 3 ── Variable type:integer ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 Balance 0 400 400 520.01 459.76 0 68.75 459.5 863 1999 Limit 0 400 400 4735.6 2308.2 855 3088 4622.5 5872.75 13913 hist ▇▃▃▃▂▁▁▁ ▅▇▇▃▂▁▁▁ ── Variable type:numeric ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 Income 0 400 400 45.22 35.24 10.35 21.01 33.12 57.47 186.63 hist ▇▃▂▁▁▁▁▁ We observe for example: The mean and median credit card balance are $520.01 and $459.50 respectively. 25% of card holders had debts of $68.75 or less. The mean and median credit card limit are $4735.6 and $4622.50 respectively. 75% of these card holders had incomes of $57,470 or less. Since our outcome variable Balance and the explanatory variables Limit and Income are numerical, we can compute the correlation coefficient between pairs of these variables. First, we could run the get_correlation() command as seen in Subsection 6.1.1 twice, once for each explanatory variable: Credit %&gt;% get_correlation(Balance ~ Limit) Credit %&gt;% get_correlation(Balance ~ Income) Or we can simultaneously compute them by returning a correlation matrix in Table 7.2. We can read off the correlation coefficient for any pair of variables by looking them up in the appropriate row/column combination. Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Limit, Income) %&gt;% cor() TABLE 7.2: Correlations between credit card balance, credit limit, and income Balance Limit Income Balance 1.000 0.862 0.464 Limit 0.862 1.000 0.792 Income 0.464 0.792 1.000 For example, the correlation coefficient of: Balance with itself is 1 as we would expect based on the definition of the correlation coefficient. Balance with Limit is 0.862. This indicates a strong positive linear relationship, which makes sense as only individuals with large credit limits can accrue large credit card balances. Balance with Income is 0.464. This is suggestive of another positive linear relationship, although not as strong as the relationship between Balance and Limit. As an added bonus, we can read off the correlation coefficient of the two explanatory variables, Limit and Income of 0.792. In this case, we say there is a high degree of collinearity between these two explanatory variables. Collinearity (or multicollinearity) is a phenomenon in which one explanatory variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. So in this case, if we knew someone’s credit card Limit and since Limit and Income are highly correlated, we could make a fairly accurate guess as to that person’s Income. Or put loosely, these two variables provided redundant information. For now let’s ignore any issues related to collinearity and press on. Let’s visualize the relationship of the outcome variable with each of the two explanatory variables in two separate plots: ggplot(Credit, aes(x = Limit, y = Balance)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Credit limit (in $)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card balance (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between balance and credit limit&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) ggplot(Credit, aes(x = Income, y = Balance)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Income (in $1000)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card balance (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between balance and income&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 7.1: Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income First, there is a positive relationship between credit limit and balance, since as credit limit increases so also does credit card balance; this is to be expected given the strongly positive correlation coefficient of 0.862. In the case of income, the positive relationship doesn’t appear as strong, given the weakly positive correlation coefficient of 0.464. However the two plots in Figure 7.1 only focus on the relationship of the outcome variable with each of the explanatory variables independently. To get a sense of the joint relationship of all three variables simultaneously through a visualization, let’s display the data in a 3-dimensional (3D) scatterplot, where The numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) Balance is on the z-axis (vertical axis) The two numerical explanatory variables form the “floor” axes. In this case The first numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\) Income is on of the floor axes. The second numerical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\) Limit is on the other floor axis. Click on the following image to open an interactive 3D scatterplot in your browser: Previously in Figure 6.6, we plotted a “best-fitting” regression line through a set of points where the numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) was teaching score and a single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) was bty_avg. What is the analogous concept when we have two numerical predictor variables? Instead of a best-fitting line, we now have a best-fitting plane, which is a 3D generalization of lines which exist in 2D. Click here to open an interactive plot of the regression plane shown below in your browser. Move the image around, zoom in, and think about how this plane generalizes the concept of a linear regression line to three dimensions. FIGURE 7.2: Regression plane Learning check (LC7.1) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same outcome variable \\(y\\) being Balance but with Rating and Age as the new explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Remember, this involves three things: Looking at the raw values Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest. Creating informative visualizations What can you say about the relationship between a credit card holder’s balance and their credit rating and age? 7.1.2 Multiple regression Just as we did when we had a single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) in Subsection 6.1.2 and when we had a single categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) in Subsection 6.2.2, we fit a regression model and obtained the regression table in our two numerical explanatory variable scenario. To fit a regression model and get a table using get_regression_table(), we now use a + to consider multiple explanatory variables. In this case since we want to perform a regression of Limit and Income simultaneously, we input Balance ~ Limit + Income. Balance_model &lt;- lm(Balance ~ Limit + Income, data = Credit) get_regression_table(Balance_model) TABLE 7.3: Multiple regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept -385.179 19.465 -19.8 0 -423.446 -346.912 Limit 0.264 0.006 45.0 0 0.253 0.276 Income -7.663 0.385 -19.9 0 -8.420 -6.906 How do we interpret these three values that define the regression plane? Intercept: -$385.18 (rounded to two decimal points to represent cents). The intercept in our case represents the credit card balance for an individual who has both a credit Limit of $0 and Income of $0. In our data however, the intercept has limited practical interpretation as no individuals had Limit or Income values of $0 and furthermore the smallest credit card balance was $0. Rather, it is used to situate the regression plane in 3D space. Limit: $0.26. Now that we have multiple variables to consider, we have to add a caveat to our interpretation: taking all other variables in our model into account, for every increase of one unit in credit Limit (dollars), there is an associated increase of on average $0.26 in credit card balance. Note: Just as we did in Subsection 6.1.2, we are not making any causal statements, only statements relating to the association between credit limit and balance We need to preface our interpretation of the associated effect of Limit with the statement “taking all other variables into account”, in this case Income, to emphasize that we are now jointly interpreting the associated effect of multiple explanatory variables in the same model and not in isolation. Income: -$7.66. Similarly, taking all other variables into account, for every increase of one unit in Income (in other words, $1000 in income), there is an associated decrease of on average $7.66 in credit card balance. However, recall in Figure 7.1 that when considered separately, both Limit and Income had positive relationships with the outcome variable Balance. As card holders’ credit limits increased their credit card balances tended to increase as well, and a similar relationship held for incomes and balances. In the above multiple regression, however, the slope for Income is now -7.66, suggesting a negative relationship between income and credit card balance. What explains these contradictory results? This is known as Simpson’s Paradox, a phenomenon in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. We expand on this in Subsection 7.3.2 where we’ll look at the relationship between credit Limit and credit card balance but split by different income bracket groups. Learning check (LC7.2) Fit a new simple linear regression using lm(Balance ~ Rating + Age, data = Credit) where Rating and Age are the new numerical explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above? 7.1.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals As we did previously in Table 7.4, let’s unpack the output of the get_regression_points() function for our model for credit card balance for all 400 card holders in the dataset. Recall that each card holder corresponds to one of the 400 rows in the Credit data frame and also for one of the 400 3D points in the 3D scatterplots in Subsection 7.1.1. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(Balance_model) regression_points TABLE 7.4: Regression points (first 5 rows of 400) ID Balance Limit Income Balance_hat residual 1 333 3606 14.9 454 -120.8 2 903 6645 106.0 559 344.3 3 580 7075 104.6 683 -103.4 4 964 9504 148.9 986 -21.7 5 331 4897 55.9 481 -150.0 Recall the format of the output: Balance corresponds to \\(y\\) (the observed value) Balance_hat corresponds to \\(\\widehat{y}\\) (the fitted value) residual corresponds to \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) (the residual) 7.2 One numerical &amp; one categorical explanatory variable Let’s revisit the instructor evaluation data introduced in Section 6.1, where we studied the relationship between instructor evaluation scores and their beauty scores. This analysis suggested that there is a positive relationship between bty_avg and score, in other words as instructors had higher beauty scores, they also tended to have higher teaching evaluation scores. Now let’s say instead of bty_avg we are interested in the numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\) age and furthermore we want to use a second explanatory variable \\(x_2\\), the (binary) categorical variable gender. Note: This study only focused on the gender binary of &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; when the data was collected and analyzed years ago. It has been tradition to use gender as an “easy” binary variable in the past in statistical analyses. We have chosen to include it here because of the interesting results of the study, but we also understand that a segment of the population is not included in this dichotomous assignment of gender and we advocate for more inclusion in future studies to show representation of groups that do not identify with the gender binary. We now resume our analyses using this evals data and hope that others find these results interesting and worth further exploration. Our modeling scenario now becomes A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\). As before, instructor evaluation score. Two explanatory variables: A numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\): in this case, their age. A categorical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\): in this case, their binary gender. 7.2.1 Exploratory data analysis Let’s reload the evals data and select() only the needed subset of variables. Note that these are different than the variables chosen in Chapter 6. Let’s given this the name evals_ch7. evals_ch7 &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, age, gender) Let’s look at the raw data values both by bringing up RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer and the glimpse() function, although in Table 7.5 we only show 5 randomly selected instructors out of 463: View(evals_ch7) TABLE 7.5: Random sample of 5 instructors score age gender 3.6 34 male 4.9 43 male 3.3 47 male 4.4 33 female 4.7 60 male Let’s look at some summary statistics using the skim() function from the skimr package: evals_ch7 %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 463 n variables: 3 ── Variable type:factor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── variable missing complete n n_unique top_counts ordered gender 0 463 463 2 mal: 268, fem: 195, NA: 0 FALSE ── Variable type:integer ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist age 0 463 463 48.37 9.8 29 42 48 57 73 ▅▅▅▇▅▇▂▁ ── Variable type:numeric ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist score 0 463 463 4.17 0.54 2.3 3.8 4.3 4.6 5 ▁▁▂▃▅▇▇▆ Furthermore, let’s compute the correlation between two numerical variables we have score and age. Recall that correlation coefficients only exist between numerical variables. We observe that they are weakly negatively correlated. evals_ch7 %&gt;% get_correlation(formula = score ~ age) # A tibble: 1 x 1 correlation &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.107 In Figure 7.3, we plot a scatterplot of score over age. Given that gender is a binary categorical variable in this study, we can make some interesting tweaks: We can assign a color to points from each of the two levels of gender: female and male. Furthermore, the geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) layer automatically fits a different regression line for each since we have provided color = gender at the top level in ggplot(). This allows for all geom_etries that follow to have the same mapping of aes()thetics to variables throughout the plot. ggplot(evals_ch7, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) + geom_jitter() + labs(x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, color = &quot;Gender&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 7.3: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin split by gender (jittered) We notice some interesting trends: There are almost no women faculty over the age of 60. We can see this by the lack of red dots above 60. Fitting separate regression lines for men and women, we see they have different slopes. We see that the associated effect of increasing age seems to be much harsher for women than men. In other words, as women age, the drop in their teaching score appears to be faster. 7.2.2 Multiple regression: Parallel slopes model Much like we started to consider multiple explanatory variables using the + sign in Subsection 7.1.2, let’s fit a regression model and get the regression table. This time we provide the name of score_model_2 to our regression model fit, in so as to not overwrite the model score_model from Section 6.1.2. score_model_2 &lt;- lm(score ~ age + gender, data = evals_ch7) get_regression_table(score_model_2) TABLE 7.6: Regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.484 0.125 35.79 0.000 4.238 4.730 age -0.009 0.003 -3.28 0.001 -0.014 -0.003 gendermale 0.191 0.052 3.63 0.000 0.087 0.294 The modeling equation for this scenario is: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{y} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + b_2 \\cdot x_2 \\\\ \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x) \\end{align}\\] where \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x)\\) is an indicator function for sex == male. In other words, \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x)\\) equals one if the current observation corresponds to a male professor, and 0 if the current observation corresponds to a female professor. This model can be visualized in Figure 7.4. FIGURE 7.4: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin by gender: same slope We see that: Females are treated as the baseline for comparison for no other reason than “female” is alphabetically earlier than “male.” The \\(b_{male} = 0.1906\\) is the vertical “bump” that men get in their teaching evaluation scores. Or more precisely, it is the average difference in teaching score that men get relative to the baseline of women. Accordingly, the intercepts (which in this case make no sense since no instructor can have an age of 0) are : for women: \\(b_0\\) = 4.484 for men: \\(b_0 + b_{male}\\) = 4.484 + 0.191 = 4.675 Both men and women have the same slope. In other words, in this model the associated effect of age is the same for men and women. So for every increase of one year in age, there is on average an associated change of \\(b_{age}\\) = -0.009 (a decrease) in teaching score. But wait, why is Figure 7.4 different than Figure 7.3! What is going on? What we have in the original plot is known as an interaction effect between age and gender. Focusing on fitting a model for each of men and women, we see that the resulting regression lines are different. Thus, gender appears to interact in different ways for men and women with the different values of age. 7.2.3 Multiple regression: Interaction model We say a model has an interaction effect if the associated effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable. These types of models usually prove to be tricky to view on first glance because of their complexity. In this case, the effect of age will depend on the value of gender. Put differently, the effect of age on teaching scores will differ for men and for women, as was suggested by the different slopes for men and women in our visual exploratory data analysis in Figure 7.3. Let’s fit a regression with an interaction term. Instead of using the + sign in the enumeration of explanatory variables, we use the * sign. Let’s fit this regression and save it in score_model_3, then we get the regression table using the get_regression_table() function as before. score_model_interaction &lt;- lm(score ~ age * gender, data = evals_ch7) get_regression_table(score_model_interaction) TABLE 7.7: Regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.883 0.205 23.80 0.000 4.480 5.286 age -0.018 0.004 -3.92 0.000 -0.026 -0.009 gendermale -0.446 0.265 -1.68 0.094 -0.968 0.076 age:gendermale 0.014 0.006 2.45 0.015 0.003 0.024 The modeling equation for this scenario is: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{y} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + b_2 \\cdot x_2 + b_3 \\cdot x_1 \\cdot x_2\\\\ \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x) + b_{\\mbox{age,male}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x) \\end{align}\\] Oof, that’s a lot of rows in the regression table output and a lot of terms in the model equation. The fourth term being added on the right hand side of the equation corresponds to the interaction term. Let’s simplify things by considering men and women separately. First, recall that \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x)\\) equals 1 if a particular observation (or row in evals_ch7) corresponds to a male instructor. In this case, using the values from the regression table the fitted value of \\(\\widehat{\\mbox{score}}\\) is: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x) + b_{\\mbox{age,male}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot 1 + b_{\\mbox{age,male}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\cdot 1 \\\\ &amp;= \\left(b_0 + b_{\\mbox{male}}\\right) + \\left(b_{\\mbox{age}} + b_{\\mbox{age,male}} \\right) \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\\\ &amp;= \\left(4.883 + -0.446\\right) + \\left(-0.018 + 0.014 \\right) \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\\\ &amp;= 4.437 -0.004 \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\end{align}\\] Second, recall that \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x)\\) equals 0 if a particular observation corresponds to a female instructor. Again, using the values from the regression table the fitted value of \\(\\widehat{\\mbox{score}}\\) is: \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x) + b_{\\mbox{age,male}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{\\mbox{is male}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot 0 + b_{\\mbox{age,male}}\\mbox{age} \\cdot 0 \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age}\\\\ &amp;= 4.883 -0.018 \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\end{align}\\] Let’s summarize these values in a table: TABLE 7.8: Comparison of male and female intercepts and age slopes Gender Intercept Slope for age Male instructors 4.44 -0.004 Female instructors 4.88 -0.018 We see that while male instructors have a lower intercept, as they age, they have a less steep associated average decrease in teaching scores: 0.004 teaching score units per year as opposed to -0.018 for women. This is consistent with the different slopes and intercepts of the red and blue regression lines fit in Figure 7.3. Recall our definition of a model having an interaction effect: when the associated effect of one variable, in this case age, depends on the value of another variable, in this case gender. But how do we know when it’s appropriate to include an interaction effect? For example, which is the more appropriate model? The regular multiple regression model without an interaction term we saw in Section 7.2.2 or the multiple regression model with the interaction term we just saw? We’ll revisit this question in Chapter 11 on “inference for regression.” 7.2.4 Observed/fitted values and residuals Now say we want to apply the above calculations for male and female instructors for all 463 instructors in the evals_ch7 dataset. As our multiple regression models get more and more complex, computing such values by hand gets more and more tedious. The get_regression_points() function spares us this tedium and returns all fitted values and all residuals. For simplicity, let’s focus only on the fitted interaction model, which is saved in score_model_interaction. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(score_model_interaction) regression_points TABLE 7.9: Regression points (first 5 rows of 463) ID score age gender score_hat residual 1 4.7 36 female 4.25 0.448 2 4.1 36 female 4.25 -0.152 3 3.9 36 female 4.25 -0.352 4 4.8 36 female 4.25 0.548 5 4.6 59 male 4.20 0.399 Recall the format of the output: score corresponds to \\(y\\) the observed value score_hat corresponds to \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\mbox{score}}\\) the fitted value residual corresponds to the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) 7.3 Related topics 7.3.1 More on the correlation coefficient Recall from Table 7.2 that we saw the correlation coefficient between Income in thousands of dollars and credit card Balance was 0.464. What if in instead we looked at the correlation coefficient between Income and credit card Balance, but where Income was in dollars and not thousands of dollars? This can be done by multiplying Income by 1000. library(ISLR) data(Credit) Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Income) %&gt;% mutate(Income = Income * 1000) %&gt;% cor() TABLE 7.10: Correlation between income (in dollars) and credit card balance Balance Income Balance 1.000 0.464 Income 0.464 1.000 We see it is the same! We say that the correlation coefficient is invariant to linear transformations! In other words, the correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be the same as the correlation between \\(a\\times x + b\\) and \\(y\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are numerical values (real numbers in mathematical terms). 7.3.2 Simpson’s Paradox Recall in Section 7.1, we saw the two following seemingly contradictory results when studying the relationship between credit card balance, credit limit, and income. On the one hand, the right hand plot of Figure 7.1 suggested that credit card balance and income were positively related: FIGURE 7.5: Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income On the other hand, the multiple regression in Table 7.3, suggested that when modeling credit card balance as a function of both credit limit and income at the same time, credit limit has a negative relationship with balance, as evidenced by the slope of -7.66. How can this be? First, let’s dive a little deeper into the explanatory variable Limit. Figure 7.6 shows a histogram of all 400 values of Limit, along with vertical red lines that cut up the data into quartiles, meaning: 25% of credit limits were between $0 and $3088. Let’s call this the “low” credit limit bracket. 25% of credit limits were between $3088 and $4622. Let’s call this the “medium-low” credit limit bracket. 25% of credit limits were between $4622 and $5873. Let’s call this the “medium-high” credit limit bracket. 25% of credit limits were over $5873. Let’s call this the “high” credit limit bracket. `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. FIGURE 7.6: Histogram of credit limits and quartiles Let’s now display The scatterplot showing the relationship between credit card balance and limit (the right-hand plot of Figure 7.1). The scatterplot showing the relationship between credit card balance and limit now with a color aesthetic added corresponding to the credit limit bracket. FIGURE 7.7: Relationship between credit card balance and income for different credit limit brackets In the right-hand plot, the Red points (bottom-left) correspond to the low credit limit bracket. Green points correspond to the medium-low credit limit bracket. Blue points correspond to the medium-high credit limit bracket. Purple points (top-right) correspond to the high credit limit bracket. The left-hand plot focuses of the relationship between balance and income in aggregate, but the right-hand plot focuses on the relationship between balance and income broken down by credit limit bracket. Whereas in aggregate there is an overall positive relationship, when broken down we now see that for the low (red points), medium-low (green points), and medium-high (blue points) income bracket groups, the strong positive relationship between credit card balance and income disappears! Only for the high bracket does the relationship stay somewhat positive. In this example, credit limit is a confounding variable for credit card balance and income. 7.4 Conclusion 7.4.1 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. 7.4.2 What’s to come? Congratulations! We’re ready to proceed to the third portion of this book: “statistical inference” using a new package called infer. Once we’ve covered Chapters 8 on sampling, 9 on confidence intervals, and 10 on hypothesis testing, we’ll come back to the models we’ve seen in “data modeling” in Chapter 11 on inference for regression. As we said at the end of Chapter 6, we’ll see why we’ve been conducting the residual analyses from Subsections 11.4.3 and 11.4.4. We are actually verifying some very important assumptions that must be met for the std_error (standard error), p_value, conf_low and conf_high (the end-points of the confidence intervals) columns in our regression tables to have valid interpretation.

["8-sampling.html", "Chapter 8 Sampling 8.1 Sampling activity 8.2 Computer simulation 8.3 Sampling framework 8.4 Case study: Polls 8.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 8 Sampling In this chapter we kick off the third segment of this book, statistical inference, by learning about sampling. The concepts behind sampling form the basis of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, which we’ll cover in Chapters 9 and 10 respectively. We will see that the tools that you learned in the data science segment of this book, in particular data visualization and data wrangling, will also play an important role here in the development of your understanding. As mentioned before, the concepts throughout this text all build into a culmination allowing you to “think with data.” Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(moderndive) 8.1 Sampling activity Let’s start with a hands-on activity. 8.1.1 What proportion of this bowl’s balls are red? Take a look at the bowl in Figure 8.1. It has a certain number of red and a certain number of white balls all of equal size. Furthermore, it appears the bowl has been mixed beforehand as there does not seem to be any particular pattern to the spatial distribution of red and white balls. Let’s now ask ourselves, what proportion of this bowl’s balls are red? FIGURE 8.1: A bowl with red and white balls. One way to answer this question would be to perform an exhaustive count: remove each ball individually, count the number of red balls and the number of white balls, and divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls. However this would be a long and tedious process. 8.1.2 Using the shovel once Instead of performing an exhaustive count, let’s insert a shovel into the bowl as seen in Figure 8.2. FIGURE 8.2: Inserting a shovel into the bowl. Using the shovel we remove a number of balls as seen in Figure 8.3. FIGURE 8.3: Fifty balls from the bowl. Observe that 17 of the balls are red and there are a total of 5 x 10 = 50 balls and thus 0.34 = 34% of the shovel’s balls are red. We can view the proportion of balls that are red in this shovel as a guess of the proportion of balls that are red in the entire bowl. While not as exact as doing an exhaustive count, our guess of 34% took much less time and energy to obtain. However, say, we started this activity over from the beginning. In other words, we replace the 50 balls back into the bowl and start over. Would we remove exactly 17 red balls again? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red be exactly 34% again? Maybe? What if we repeated this exercise several times? Would I obtain exactly 17 red balls each time? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red be exactly 34% every time? Surely not. Let’s actually do and observe the results with the help of 33 of our friends. 8.1.3 Using the shovel 33 times Each of our 33 friends will do the following: use the shovel to remove 50 balls each, count the number of red balls, use this number to compute the proportion of the 50 balls they removed that are red, return the balls into the bowl, and mix the contents of the bowl a little to not let a previous group’s results influence the next group’s set of results. FIGURE 8.4: Repeating sampling activity 33 times. However, before returning the balls into the bowl, they are going to mark the proportion of the 50 balls they removed that are red in a histogram as seen in Figure 8.5. FIGURE 8.5: Constructing a histogram of proportions. Recall from Section 3.5 that histograms allow us to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable: where the values center and in particular how they vary. The resulting hand-drawn histogram can be seen in Figure 8.6. FIGURE 8.6: Hand-drawn histogram of 33 proportions. Observe the following about the histogram in Figure 8.6: At the low end, one group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion between 0.20 = 20% and 0.25 = 25% At the high end, another group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion between 0.45 = 45% and 0.5 = 50% red. However the most frequently occurring proportions were between 0.30 = 30% and 0.35 = 35% red, right in the middle of the distribution. The shape of this distribution is somewhat bell-shaped. Let’s construct this same hand-drawn histogram in R using your data visualization skills that you honed in Chapter 3. We saved our 33 group of friends’ proportion red in a data frame tactile_prop_red which is included in the moderndive package you loaded earlier. tactile_prop_red View(tactile_prop_red) Let’s display only the first 10 out of 33 rows of tactile_prop_red’s contents in Table 8.1. TABLE 8.1: First 10 out of 33 groups’ proportion of 50 balls that are red. group replicate red_balls prop_red Ilyas, Yohan 1 21 0.42 Morgan, Terrance 2 17 0.34 Martin, Thomas 3 21 0.42 Clark, Frank 4 21 0.42 Riddhi, Karina 5 18 0.36 Andrew, Tyler 6 19 0.38 Julia 7 19 0.38 Rachel, Lauren 8 11 0.22 Daniel, Caroline 9 15 0.30 Josh, Maeve 10 17 0.34 Observe for each group we have their names, the number of red_balls they obtained, and the corresponding proportion out of 50 balls that were red named prop_red. Observe, we also have a variable replicate enumerating each of the 33 groups; we chose this name because each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated activity: using the shovel to remove 50 balls and computing the proportion of those balls that are red. We visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions using a geom_histogram() with binwidth = 0.05 in Figure 8.7, which is appropriate since the variable prop_red is numerical. This computer-generated histogram matches our hand-drawn histogram from the earlier Figure 8.6. ggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 50 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of 33 proportions red&quot;) FIGURE 8.7: Distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50 8.1.4 What are we doing here? What we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical concept of sampling. We would like to know the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red, but because the bowl has a very large number of balls performing an exhaustive count of the number of red and white balls in the bowl would be very costly in terms of both time and energy. We therefore extract a sample of 50 balls using the shovel. Using this sample of 50 balls, we estimate the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red using the proportion of the shovel’s balls that are red. This estimate in our earlier example was 17 red balls out of 50 balls = 34%. Moreover, because we mixed the balls before each use of the shovel, the samples were randomly drawn. Because each sample was drawn at random, the samples were different from each other. Because the samples were different from each other, we obtained the different proportions red observed in Table 8.1. This is known as the concept of sampling variation. In Section 8.2 we’ll mimic the hands-on sampling activity we just performed in a computer simulation; using a computer will allow us to repeat the above sampling activity much more than 33 times. Using a computer, not only will be able to repeat the hands-on activity a very large number of times, but we will also be able to repeat it using different sized shovels. The purpose of these simulations is to develop an understanding of two key concepts relating to sampling: understanding the concept of sampling variation and the role that sample size plays in this variation. To this end, we’ll present you with definitions, terminology, and notation related to sampling in Section 8.3. As with many disciplines, there are definitions, terminology, and notation that seem very inaccessible and even confusing at first. However, as with many difficult topics, if you truly understand the underlying concepts and practice, practice, practice, you’ll be able to master these topics. To tie the contents of this chapter to the real-word, we’ll present an example of one of the most recognizable uses of sampling: polls. In Section 8.4 we’ll look at a particular case study: a 2013 poll on then President Obama’s popularity among young Americans, conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. We’ll close this chapter by generalizing the above sampling from the bowl activity to other scenarios, distinguishing between random sampling and random assignment, presenting the theoretical result underpinning all our results, and presenting a few mathematical formulas that relate to the concepts and ideas explored in this chapter. 8.2 Computer simulation What we performed in Section 8.1 is a simulation of sampling. In other words, we were not in a real-life sampling scenario in order to answer a real-life question, but rather we were mimicking such a scenario with our bowl and shovel. The crowd-sourced Wikipedia definition of a simulation states: “A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system.”1 One example of simulations in practice are a flight simulators: before pilots in training are allowed to fly an actual plane, they first practice on a computer that attempts to mimic the reality of flying an actual plane as best as possible. Now you might be thinking that simulations must necessarily take place on computer. However, this is not necessarily true. Take for example crash test dummies: before cars are made available to the market, automobile engineers test their safety by mimicking the reality for passengers of being in an automobile crash. To distinguish between these two simulation types, we’ll term a simulation performed in real-life as a “tactile” simulation done with your hands and to the touch as opposed to a “virtual” simulation performed on a computer. Example of a “tactile” simulation Example of “virtual” simulation So while in Section 8.1 we performed a “tactile” simulation of sampling using an actual bowl and an actual shovel with our hands, in this section we’ll perform a “virtual” simulation using a “virtual” bowl and a “virtual” shovel with our computers. 8.2.1 Using the virtual shovel once Let’s start by performing the virtual analogue of the tactile sampling simulation we performed in 8.1. We first need a virtual analogue of the bowl seen in Figure 8.1. To this end, we included a data frame bowl in the moderndive package whose rows correspond exactly with the contents of the actual bowl. bowl # A tibble: 2,400 x 2 ball_ID color &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 white 2 2 white 3 3 white 4 4 red 5 5 white 6 6 white 7 7 red 8 8 white 9 9 red 10 10 white # … with 2,390 more rows Observe in the output that bowl has 2400 rows, telling us that the bowl contains 2400 equally-sized balls. The first variable ball_ID is used merely as an “identification variable” for this data frame as discussed in Subsection 2.4.4; none of the balls in the actual bowl are marked with numbers. The second variable color indicates whether a particular virtual ball is red or white. View the contents of the bowl in RStudio’s data viewer and scroll through the contents to convince yourselves that bowl is indeed a virtual version of the actual bowl in Figure 8.1. Now that we have a virtual analogue of our bowl, we now need a virtual analogue for the shovel seen in Figure 8.2; we’ll use this virtual shovel to generate our virtual random samples of 50 balls. We’re going to use the rep_sample_n() function included in the moderndive package. This function allows us to take repeated, or replicated, samples of size n. Run the following and explore virtual_shovel’s contents in the RStudio viewer. virtual_shovel &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50) View(virtual_shovel) Let’s display only the first 10 out of 50 rows of virtual_shovel’s contents in Table 8.2. TABLE 8.2: First 10 sampled balls of 50 in virtual sample replicate ball_ID color 1 1500 white 1 1767 red 1 1035 white 1 245 white 1 1121 white 1 1828 white 1 721 white 1 1729 red 1 770 white 1 1499 red The ball_ID variable identifies which of the balls from bowl are included in our sample of 50 balls and color denotes its color. However what does the replicate variable indicate? In virtual_shovel’s case, replicate is equal to 1 for all 50 rows. This is telling us that these 50 rows correspond to a first repeated/replicated use of the shovel, in our case our first sample. We’ll see below when we “virtually” take 33 samples, replicate will take values between 1 and 33. Before we do this, let’s compute the proportion of balls in our virtual sample of size 50 that are red using the dplyr data wrangling verbs you learned in Chapter 4. Let’s breakdown the steps individually: First, for each of our 50 sampled balls, identify if it is red using a test for equality using ==. For every row where color == &quot;red&quot;, the Boolean TRUE is returned and for every row where color is not equal to &quot;red&quot;, the Boolean FALSE is returned. Let’s create a new Boolean variable is_red using the mutate() function from Section 4.5: virtual_shovel %&gt;% mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 50 x 4 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ball_ID color is_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; 1 1 1500 white FALSE 2 1 1767 red TRUE 3 1 1035 white FALSE 4 1 245 white FALSE 5 1 1121 white FALSE 6 1 1828 white FALSE 7 1 721 white FALSE 8 1 1729 red TRUE 9 1 770 white FALSE 10 1 1499 red TRUE # … with 40 more rows Second, we compute the number of balls out of 50 that are red using the summarize() function. Recall from Section 4.3 that summarize() takes a data frame with many rows and returns a data frame with a single row containing summary statistics that you specify, like mean() and median(). In this case we use the sum(): virtual_shovel %&gt;% mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% summarize(num_red = sum(is_red)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 replicate num_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 17 Why does this work? Because R treats TRUE like the number 1 and FALSE like the number 0. So summing the number of TRUE’s and FALSE’s is equivalent to summing 1’s and 0’s, which in the end counts the number of balls where color is red. In our case, 17 of the 50 balls were red. Third and last, we compute the proportion of the 50 sampled balls that are red by dividing num_red by 50: virtual_shovel %&gt;% mutate(is_red = color == &quot;red&quot;) %&gt;% summarize(num_red = sum(is_red)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = num_red / 50) # A tibble: 1 x 3 replicate num_red prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 17 0.34 In other words, this “virtual” sample’s balls were 34% red. Let’s make the above code a little more compact and succinct by combining the first mutate() and the summarize() as follows: virtual_shovel %&gt;% summarize(num_red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = num_red / 50) # A tibble: 1 x 3 replicate num_red prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 17 0.34 Great! 34% of virtual_shovel’s 50 balls were red! So based on this particular sample, our guess at the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red is 34%. But remember from our earlier tactile sampling activity that if we repeated this sampling, we would not necessarily obtain a sample of 50 balls with 34% of them being red again; there will likely be some variation. In fact in Table 8.2 we displayed 33 such proportions based on 33 tactile samples and then in Figure 8.6 we visualized the distribution of the 33 proportions in a histogram. Let’s now perform the virtual analogue of having 33 groups of students use the sampling shovel! 8.2.2 Using the virtual shovel 33 times Recall that in our tactile sampling exercise in Section 8.1 we had 33 groups of students each use the shovel, yielding 33 samples of size 50 balls, which we then used to compute 33 proportions. In other words we repeated/replicated using the shovel 33 times. We can perform this repeated/replicated sampling virtually by once again using our virtual shovel function rep_sample_n(), but by adding the reps = 33 argument, indicating we want to repeat the sampling 33 times. Be sure to scroll through the contents of virtual_samples in RStudio’s viewer. virtual_samples &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 33) View(virtual_samples) Observe that while the first 50 rows of replicate are equal to 1, the next 50 rows of replicate are equal to 2. This is telling us that the first 50 rows correspond to the first sample of 50 balls while the next 50 correspond to the second sample of 50 balls. This pattern continues for all reps = 33 replicates and thus virtual_samples has 33 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 1650 rows. Let’s now take the data frame virtual_samples with 33 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 1650 rows corresponding to 33 samples of size 50 balls and compute the resulting 33 proportions red. We’ll use the same dplyr verbs as we did in the previous section, but this time with an additional group_by() of the replicate variable. Recall from Section 4.4 that by assigning the grouping variable “meta-data” before summarizing(), we’ll obtain 33 different proportions red: virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) View(virtual_prop_red) Let’s display only the first 10 out of 33 rows of virtual_prop_red’s contents in Table 8.1. As one would expect, there is variation in the resulting prop_red proportions red for the first 10 out 33 repeated/replicated samples. TABLE 8.3: First 10 out of 33 virtual proportion of 50 balls that are red. replicate red prop_red 1 18 0.36 2 20 0.40 3 19 0.38 4 18 0.36 5 15 0.30 6 18 0.36 7 19 0.38 8 13 0.26 9 23 0.46 10 14 0.28 Let’s visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions red based on 33 virtual samples using a histogram with binwidth = 0.05 in Figure 8.8. ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 50 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of 33 proportions red&quot;) FIGURE 8.8: Distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50 Observe that occasionally we obtained proportions red that are less than 0.3 = 30%, while on the other hand we occasionally we obtained proportions that are greater than 0.45 = 45%. However, the most frequently occurring proportions red out of 50 balls were between 35% and 40% (for 11 out 33 samples). Why do we have these differences in proportions red? Because of sampling variation. Let’s now compare our virtual results with our tactile results from the previous section in Figure 8.9. We see that both histograms, in other words the distribution of the 33 proportions red, are somewhat similar in their center and spread although not identical. These slight differences are again due to random variation. Furthermore both distributions are somewhat bell-shaped. FIGURE 8.9: Comparing 33 virtual and 33 tactile proportions red. 8.2.3 Using the virtual shovel 1000 times Now say we want study the variation in proportions red not based on 33 repeated/replicated samples, but rather a very large number of samples say 1000 samples. We have two choices at this point. We could have our students manually take 1000 samples of 50 balls and compute the corresponding 1000 proportion red out 50 balls. This would be cruel and unusual however, as this would be very tedious and time-consuming. This is where computers excel: automating long and repetitive tasks while performing them very quickly. Therefore at this point we will abandon tactile sampling in favor of only virtual sampling. Let’s once again use the rep_sample_n() function with sample size set to 50 once again, but this time with the number of replicates reps = 1000. Be sure to scroll through the contents of virtual_samples in RStudio’s viewer. virtual_samples &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000) View(virtual_samples) Observe that now virtual_samples has 1000 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 50,000 rows, instead of the 33 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 1650 rows from earlier. Using the same code as earlier, let’s take the data frame virtual_samples with 1000 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 50,000 and compute the resulting 1000 proportions red. virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) View(virtual_prop_red) Observe that we now have 1000 replicates of prop_red, the proportion of 50 balls that are red. Using the same code as earlier, let’s now visualize the distribution of these 1000 replicates of prop_red in a histogram in Figure 8.10. ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 50 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of 1000 proportions red&quot;) FIGURE 8.10: Distribution of 1000 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50 Once again, the most frequently occurring proportions red occur between 35% and 40%. Every now and then, we obtain proportions as low as between 20% and 25%, and others as high as between 55% and 60%. These are rare however. Furthermore observe that we now have a much more symmetric and smoother bell-shaped distribution. This distribution is in fact a Normal distribution; see Appendix A for a brief discussion on properties of the Normal distribution. 8.2.4 Using different shovels Now say instead of just one shovel, you had three choices of shovels to extract a sample of balls with. A shovel with 25 slots A shovel with 50 slots A shovel with 100 slots If your goal was still to estimate the proportion of the bowl’s balls that were red, which shovel would you choose? In our experience, most people would choose the shovel with 100 slots since it has the biggest sample size and hence would yield the “best” guess of the proportion of the bowl’s 2400 balls that are red. Using our newly developed tools for virtual sampling simulations, let’s unpack the effect of having different sample sizes! In other words, let’s use rep_sample_n() with size = 25, size = 50, and size = 100, while keeping the number of repeated/replicated samples at 1000: Virtually use the appropriate shovel to generate 1000 samples with size balls. Compute the resulting 1000 replicated of the proportion of the shovel’s balls that are red. Visualize the distribution of these 1000 proportion red using a histogram. Run each of the following code segments individually and then compare the three resulting histograms. # Segment 1: sample size = 25 ------------------------------ # 1.a) Virtually use shovel 1000 times virtual_samples_25 &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 25, reps = 1000) # 1.b) Compute resulting 1000 replicates of proportion red virtual_prop_red_25 &lt;- virtual_samples_25 %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 25) # 1.c) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_prop_red_25, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 25 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;25&quot;) # Segment 2: sample size = 50 ------------------------------ # 2.a) Virtually use shovel 1000 times virtual_samples_50 &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000) # 2.b) Compute resulting 1000 replicates of proportion red virtual_prop_red_50 &lt;- virtual_samples_50 %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) # 2.c) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_prop_red_50, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 50 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;50&quot;) # Segment 3: sample size = 100 ------------------------------ # 3.a) Virtually using shovel with 100 slots 1000 times virtual_samples_100 &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 100, reps = 1000) # 3.b) Compute resulting 1000 replicates of proportion red virtual_prop_red_100 &lt;- virtual_samples_100 %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 100) # 3.c) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_prop_red_100, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 100 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;100&quot;) For easy comparison, we present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes in Figure 8.11. What do you observe? FIGURE 8.11: Comparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes Observe that as the sample size increases, the spread of the 1000 replicates of the proportion red decreases. In other words, as the sample size increases, there are less differences due to sampling variation and the distribution centers more tightly around the same value. Eyeballing Figure 8.11, things appear to center tightly around roughly 40%. We can be numerically explicit about the amount of spread in our 3 sets of 1000 values of prop_red using the standard deviation: a summary statistic that measures the amount of spread and variation within a numerical variable; see Appendix A for a brief discussion on properties of the standard deviation. For all three sample sizes, let’s compute the standard deviation of the 1000 proportions red by running the following data wrangling code that uses the sd() summary function. # n = 25 virtual_prop_red_25 %&gt;% summarize(sd = sd(prop_red)) # n = 50 virtual_prop_red_50 %&gt;% summarize(sd = sd(prop_red)) # n = 100 virtual_prop_red_100 %&gt;% summarize(sd = sd(prop_red)) Let’s compare these 3 measures of spread of the distributions in Table 8.4. TABLE 8.4: Comparing standard deviations of proportions red for 3 different shovels. Number of slots in shovel Standard deviation of proportions red 25 0.099 50 0.071 100 0.048 As we observed visually in Figure 8.11, as the sample size increases our numerical measure of spread decreases; there is less variation in our proportions red. In other words, as the sample size increases, our guesses at the true proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red get more consistent and precise. 8.3 Sampling framework In both our “hands-on” tactile simulations and our “virtual” simulations using a computer, we used sampling for the purpose of estimation: we extract samples in order to estimate the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. We used sampling as a cheaper and less-time consuming approach than to do a full census of all the balls. Our virtual simulations all built up to the results shown in Figure 8.11 and Table 8.4, comparing 1000 proportions red based on samples of size 25, 50, and 100. This was our first attempt at understanding two key concepts relating to sampling for estimation: The effect of sampling variation on our estimates. The effect of sample size on sampling variation. Let’s now introduce some terminology and notation as well as statistical definitions related to sampling. Given the number of new words to learn, you will likely have to read these next three subsections multiple times. Keep in mind however that none of the concepts underlying these terminology, notation, and definitions are any different than the concepts underlying our simulations in Sections 8.1 and 8.2; it will simply take time and practice to master them. 8.3.1 Terminology &amp; notation Here is a list of terminology and mathematical notation relating to sampling. For each item, we’ll be sure to tie them to our simulations in Sections 8.1 and 8.2. (Study) Population: A (study) population is a collection of individuals or observations about which we are interested. We mathematically denote the population’s size using upper case \\(N\\). In our simulations the (study) population was the collection of \\(N\\) = 2400 identically sized red and white balls contained in the bowl. Population parameter: A population parameter is a numerical summary quantity about the population that is unknown, but you wish you knew. For example, when this quantity is a mean, the population parameter of interest is the population mean which is mathematically denoted with the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) (pronounced “mu”). In our simulations however since we were interested in the proportion of the bowl’s balls that were red, the population parameter is the population proportion which is mathematically denoted with the letter \\(p\\). Census: An exhaustive enumeration or counting of all \\(N\\) individuals or observations in the population in order to compute the population parameter’s value exactly. In our simulations, this would correspond to manually going over all \\(N\\) = 2400 balls in the bowl and counting the number that are red and computing the population proportion \\(p\\) of the balls that are red exactly. When the number \\(N\\) of individuals or observations in our population is large, as was the case with our bowl, a census can be very expensive in terms of time, energy, and money. Sampling: Sampling is the act of collecting a sample from the population when we don’t have the means to perform a census. We mathematically denote the sample’s size using lower case \\(n\\), as opposed to upper case \\(N\\) which denotes the population’s size. Typically the sample size \\(n\\) is much smaller than the population size \\(N\\), thereby making sampling a much cheaper procedure than a census. In our simulations, we used shovels with 25, 50, and 100 slots to extract a sample of size \\(n\\) = 25, \\(n\\) = 50, and \\(n\\) = 100 balls. Point estimate (AKA sample statistic): A summary statistic computed from the sample that estimates the unknown population parameter. In our simulations, recall that the unknown population parameter was the population proportion and that this is mathematically denoted with \\(p\\). Our point estimate is the sample proportion: the proportion of the shovel’s balls that are red. In other words, it is our guess of the proportion of the bowl’s balls balls that are red. We mathematically denote the sample proportion using \\(\\widehat{p}\\); the “hat” on top of the \\(p\\) indicates that it is an estimate of the unknown population proportion \\(p\\). Representative sampling: A sample is said be a representative sample if it is representative of the population. In other words, are the sample’s characteristics a good representation of the population’s characteristics? In our simulations, are the samples of \\(n\\) balls extracted using our shovels representative of the bowl’s \\(N\\)=2400 balls? Generalizability: We say a sample is generalizable if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. In other words, can the value of the point estimate be generalized to estimate the value of the population parameter well? In our simulations, can we generalize the values of the sample proportions red of our shovels to the population proportion red of the bowl? Using mathematical notation, is \\(\\widehat{p}\\) a “good guess” of \\(p\\)? Bias: In a statistical sense, we say bias occurs if certain individuals or observations in a population have a higher chance of being included in a sample than others. We say a sampling procedure is unbiased if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sampled. In our simulations, since each ball had the same size and hence an equal chance of being sample in our shovels, our samples were unbiased. Random sampling: We say a sampling procedure is random if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion. In our simulations, this would correspond to sufficiently mixing the bowl before each use of the shovel. Phew, that’s a lot of new terminology and notation to learn! Let’s put them all together to describe the paradigm of sampling: If the sampling of a sample of size \\(n\\) is done at random, then the sample is unbiased and representative of the population of size \\(N\\), thus any result based on the sample can generalize to the population, thus the point estimate is a “good guess” of the unknown population parameter, thus instead of performing a census, we can infer about the population using sampling. Restricting consideration to a shovel with 50 slots from our simulations, If we extract a sample of \\(n=50\\) balls at random, in other words we mix the equally-sized balls before using the shovel, then the contents of the shovel are an unbiased representation of the contents of the bowl’s 2400 balls, thus any result based on the sample of balls can generalize to the bowl, thus the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the \\(n=50\\) balls in the shovel that are red is a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the \\(N\\)=2400 balls that are red, thus instead of manually going over all the balls in the bowl, we can infer about the bowl using the shovel. Note that last word we wrote in bold: infer. The act of “inferring” is to deduce or conclude (information) from evidence and reasoning. In our simulations, we wanted to infer about the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. Statistical inference is the theory, methods, and practice of forming judgments about the parameters of a population and the reliability of statistical relationships, typically on the basis of random sampling (Wikipedia). In other words, statistical inference is the act of inference via sampling. In the upcoming Chapter 9 on confidence intervals, we’ll introduce the infer package, which makes statistical inference “tidy” and transparent. It is why this third portion of the book is called “Statistical inference via infer”. 8.3.2 Statistical definitions Now for some important statistical definitions related to sampling. As a refresher of our 1000 repeated/replicated virtual samples of size \\(n\\) = 25, \\(n\\) = 50, and \\(n\\) = 100 in Section 8.2, let’s display Figure 8.11 again below. These types of distributions have a special name: sampling distributions; their visualization displays the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of any point estimate, in this case the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Using these sampling distributions, for a given sample size \\(n\\), we can make statements about what values we can typically expect. For example, observe the centers of all three sampling distributions: they are all roughly centered around 0.4 = 40%. Furthermore, observe that while we are somewhat likely to observe sample proportions red of 0.2 = 20% when using the shovel with 25 slots, we will almost never observe this sample proportion when using the shovel with 100 slots. Observe also the effect of sample size on the sampling variation. As the sample size \\(n\\) increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the spread/variation of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the values cluster more and more tightly around the same center of around 40%. We quantified this spread/variation using the standard deviation of our proportions in Table 8.4, which we display again below: Number of slots in shovel Standard deviation of proportions red 25 0.099 50 0.071 100 0.048 So as the number of slots in the shovel increased, this standard deviation decreased. These types of standard deviations have another special name: standard errors; they quantify the effect of sampling variation induced on our estimates. In other words, they are quantifying how much we can expect different proportions of a shovel’s balls that are red to vary from random sample to random sample. Unfortunately, many new statistics practitioners get confused by these names. For example, it’s common for people new to statistical inference to call the “sampling distribution” the “sample distribution”. Another additional source of confusion is the name “standard deviation” and “standard error”. Remember that a standard error is merely a kind of standard deviation: the standard deviation of any point estimate from a sampling scenario. In other words, all standard errors are standard deviations, but not all standard deviations are a standard error. To help reinforce these concepts, let’s re-display Figure 8.11 but using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling in Figure 8.12. FIGURE 8.12: Three sampling distributions of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Furthermore, let’s re-display Table 8.4 but using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling in Table 8.5. TABLE 8.5: Three standard errors of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) based on n = 25, 50, 100. Sample size Standard error of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) n = 25 0.099 n = 50 0.071 n = 100 0.048 Remember the key message of this last table: that as the sample size \\(n\\) goes up, the “typical” error of your point estimate as quantified by the standard error will go down. 8.3.3 The moral of the story Let’s recap this section so far. We’ve seen that if a sample is generated at random, then the resulting point estimate is a “good guess” of the true unknown population parameter. In our simulations, since we made sure to mix the balls first before extracting a sample with the shovel, the resulting sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the shovel’s balls that were red was a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the bowl’s balls that were red. However, what do we mean by our point estimate being a “good guess”? While sometimes we’ll obtain a point estimate less than the true value of the unknown population parameter, other times we’ll obtain a point estimate greater than the true value of the unknown population parameter, this is because of sampling variation. However despite this sampling variation, our point estimates will “on average” be correct. In our simulations, sometimes our sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) was less than the true population proportion \\(p\\), other times the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) was greater than the true population proportion \\(p\\). This was due to the sampling variability induced by the mixing. However despite this sampling variation, our sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\) were always centered around the true population proportion. This is also known as having an accurate estimate. What was the value of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the \\(N\\) = 2400 balls in the actual bowl? There were 900 red balls, for a proportion red of 900/2400 = 0.375 = 37.5%! How do we know this? Did the authors do an exhaustive count of all the balls? No! They were listed on the contexts of the box that the bowl came in. Hence we made the contents of the virtual bowl match the tactile bowl: bowl %&gt;% summarize(sum_red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;), sum_not_red = sum(color != &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 sum_red sum_not_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 900 1500 Let’s re-display our sampling distributions from Figures 8.11 and 8.12, but now with a vertical red line marking the true population proportion \\(p\\) of balls that are red = 37.5% in Figure 8.13. We see that while there is a certain amount of error in the sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\) for all three sampling distributions, on average the \\(\\widehat{p}\\) are centered at the true population proportion red \\(p\\). FIGURE 8.13: Three sampling distributions with population proportion \\(p\\) marked in red. We also saw in this section that as your sample size \\(n\\) increases, your point estimates will vary less and less and be more and more concentrated around the true population parameter; this is quantified by the decreasing standard error. In other words, the typical error of your point estimates will decrease. In our simulations, as the sample size increases, the spread/variation of our sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\) around the true population proportion \\(p\\) decreases. You can observe this behavior as well in Figure 8.13. This is also known as having a more precise estimate. So random sampling ensures our point estimates are accurate, while having a large sample size ensures our point estimates are precise. While accuracy and precision may sound like the same concept, they are actually not. Accuracy relates to how “on target” our estimates are whereas precision relates to how “consistent” our estimates are. Figure 8.14 illustrates the difference. FIGURE 8.14: Comparing accuracy and precision As this point you might be asking yourself: “If you already knew the true proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red was 37.5%, then what did we do any of this for?” In other words, “If you already knew the value of the true unknown population parameter, then why did we do any sampling?” You might also be asking: “Why did we take 1000 repeated/replicated samples of size n = 25, 50, and 100? Shouldn’t we be taking only one sample that’s as large as possible?” Recall our definition of a simulation from Section 8.2: an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system. We performed these simulations to study: The effect of sampling variation on our estimates. The effect of sample size on sampling variation. In a real-life scenario, we won’t know what the true value of the population parameter is and furthermore we won’t take repeated/replicated samples but rather a single sample that’s as large as we can afford. This was also done to show the power of the technique of sampling when trying to estimate a population parameter. Since we knew the value was 37.5%, we could show just how well the different sample sizes approximated this value in their sampling distributions. We present one case study of a real-life sampling scenario in the next section: polling. 8.4 Case study: Polls In December 4, 2013 National Public Radio in the US reported on a recent, at the time, poll of President Obama’s approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 in an article Poll: Support For Obama Among Young Americans Eroding. A quote from the article: After voting for him in large numbers in 2008 and 2012, young Americans are souring on President Obama. According to a new Harvard University Institute of Politics poll, just 41 percent of millennials — adults ages 18-29 — approve of Obama’s job performance, his lowest-ever standing among the group and an 11-point drop from April. Let’s tie elements of the real-life poll in this new article with our “tactile” and “virtual” simulations from Sections 8.1 and 8.2 using the terminology, notations, and definitions we learned in Section 8.3. (Study) Population: Who is the population of \\(N\\) individuals or observations of interest? Simulation: \\(N\\) = 2400 identically-sized red and white balls Obama poll: \\(N\\) = ? young Americans aged 18-29 Population parameter: What is the population parameter? Simulation: The population proportion \\(p\\) of ALL the balls in the bowl that are red. Obama poll: The population proportion \\(p\\) of ALL young Americans who approve of Obama’s job performance. Census: What would a census look like? Simulation: Manually going over all \\(N\\) = 2400 balls and exactly computing the population proportion \\(p\\) of the balls that are red, a time consuming task. Obama poll: Locating all \\(N\\) = ? young Americans and asking them all if they approve of Obama’s job performance, an expensive task. Sampling: How do you collect the sample of size \\(n\\) individuals or observations? Simulation: Using a shovel with \\(n\\) slots. Obama poll: One method is to get a list of phone numbers of all young Americans and pick out \\(n\\) phone numbers. In this poll’s case, the sample size of this poll was \\(n\\) = 2089 young Americans. Point estimate (AKA sample statistic): What is your estimate of the unknown population parameter? Simulation: The sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the balls in the shovel that were red. Obama poll: The sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of young Americans in the sample that approve of Obama’s job performance. In this poll’s case, \\(\\widehat{p}\\) = 0.41 = 41%, the quoted percentage in the second paragraph of the article. Representative sampling: Is the sampling procedure representative? Simulation: Are the contents of the shovel representative of the contents of the bowl? Obama poll: Is the sample of \\(n\\) = 2089 young Americans representative of all young Americans aged 18-29? Generalizability: Are the samples generalizable to the greater population? Simulation: Is the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the shovel’s balls that are red a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the bowl’s balls that are red? Obama poll: Is the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) = 0.41 of the sample of young Americans who support Obama a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(p\\) of all young Americans who support Obama? In other words, can we confidently say that 41% of all young Americans approve of Obama? Bias: Is the sampling procedure unbiased? In other words, do all observations have an equal chance of being included in the sample? Simulation: Since each ball was equally sized, each ball had an equal chance of being included in a shovel’s sample, and hence the sampling was unbiased. Obama poll: Did all young Americans have an equal chance at being represented in this poll? For example, if this was conducted using only mobile phone numbers, would people without mobile phones be included? What if those who disapproved of Obama were less likely to agree to take part in the poll? What about if this were an internet poll on a certain news website? Would non-readers of this website be included? We need to ask the Harvard University Institute of Politics pollsters about their sampling methodology. Random sampling: Was the sampling random? Simulation: As long as you mixed the bowl sufficiently before sampling, your samples would be random. Obama poll: Was the sample conducted at random? We need to ask the Harvard University Institute of Politics pollsters about their sampling methodology. Once again, let’s revisit the sampling paradigm: If the sampling of a sample of size \\(n\\) is done at random, then the sample is unbiased and representative of the population of size \\(N\\), thus any result based on the sample can generalize to the population, thus the point estimate is a “good guess” of the unknown population parameter, thus instead of performing a census, we can infer about the population using sampling. In our simulations using the shovel with 50 slots: If we extract a sample of \\(n\\) = 50 balls at random, in other words we mix the equally-sized balls before using the shovel, then the contents of the shovel are an unbiased representation of the contents of the bowl’s 2400 balls, thus any result based on the sample of balls can generalize to the bowl, thus the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the \\(n\\) = 50 balls in the shovel that are red is a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the \\(N\\) = 2400 balls that are red, thus instead of manually going over all the balls in the bowl, we can infer about the bowl using the shovel. In the in-real life Obama poll: If we had a way of contacting a randomly chosen sample of 2089 young Americans and poll their approval of Obama, then these 2089 young Americans would be an unbiased and representative sample of all young Americans, thus any results based on this sample of 2089 young Americans can generalize to the entire population of all young Americans, thus the reported sample approval rating of 41% of these 2089 young Americans is a good guess of the true approval rating among all young Americans, thus instead of performing a highly costly census of all young Americans, we can infer about all young Americans using polling. 8.5 Conclusion 8.5.1 Central Limit Theorem What you did in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 (in particular in Figure 8.11 and Table 8.4) was demonstrate a very famous theorem, or mathematically proven truth, called the Central Limit Theorem. It loosely states that when sample means and sample proportions are based on larger and larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of these two point estimates become more and more normally shaped and more and more narrow. In other words, their sampling distributions become more normally distributed and the spread/variation of these sampling distributions as quantified by their standard errors gets smaller. Shuyi Chiou, Casey Dunn, and Pathikrit Bhattacharyya created the following 3m38s video at https://www.youtube.com/embed/jvoxEYmQHNM explaining this crucial statistical theorem using the average weight of wild bunny rabbits and the average wing span of dragons as examples. Enjoy! 8.5.2 Summary table In this chapter, we performed both tactile and virtual simulations of sampling to infer about an unknown proportion. We also presented a case study of a sampling in real life situation: polls. In both cases, we used the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) to estimate the population proportion \\(p\\). However, we are not just limited to scenarios related statistical inference for proportions. In other words, we can consider other population parameter and point estimate scenarios than just the population proportion \\(p\\) and sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) scenarios we studied in this chapter. We present 5 more such scenarios in Table 8.6. Note that the sample mean is traditionally noted as \\(\\overline{x}\\) but can also be thought of as an estimate of the population mean \\(\\mu\\). Thus, it can also be denoted as \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) as shown below in the table. TABLE 8.6: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Notation. 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) or \\(\\overline{x}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) 5 Population regression slope \\(\\beta_1\\) Sample regression slope \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) or \\(b_1\\) 6 Population regression intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) Sample regression intercept \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) or \\(b_0\\) We’ll cover all the remaining scenarios as follows, using the terminology, notation, and definitions related to sampling you saw in Section 8.3: In Chapter 9, we’ll cover examples of statistical inference for Scenario 2: The mean age \\(\\mu\\) of all pennies in circulation in the US. Scenario 3: The difference \\(p_1 - p_2\\) in the proportion of people who yawn when seeing someone else yawn and the proportion of people who yawn without seeing someone else yawn. This is an example of two-sample inference. In Chapter 10, we’ll cover an example of statistical inference for Scenario 4: The difference \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) in average IMDB ratings for action and romance movies. This is another example of two-sample inference. In Chapter 11, we’ll cover an example of statistical inference for the relationship between teaching score and various instructor demographic variables you saw in Chapter 6 on basic regression and Chapter 7 on multiple regression. Specifically Scenario 5: The intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) of some population regression line. Scenario 6: The slope \\(\\beta_1\\) of some population regression line. 8.5.3 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. 8.5.4 What’s to come? Recall in our Obama poll case study in Section 8.4 that based on this particular sample, the Harvard University Institute of Politics’ best guess of Obama’s approval rating among all young Americans was 41%. However, this isn’t the end of the story. If you read further in the article, it states: The online survey of 2,089 adults was conducted from Oct. 30 to Nov. 11, just weeks after the federal government shutdown ended and the problems surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act began to take center stage. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. Note the term margin of error, which here is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. What this is saying is that most polls won’t get it perfectly right; there will always be a certain amount of error caused by sampling variation. The margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points is saying that a typical range of errors for polls of this type is about \\(\\pm\\) 2.1%, in words from about 2.1% too small to about 2.1% too big for an interval of [41% - 2.1%, 41% + 2.1%] = [37.9%, 43.1%]. Remember that this notation corresponds to 37.9% and 43.1% being included as well as all numbers between the two of them. We’ll see in the next chapter that such intervals are known as confidence intervals. Wikipedia entry for simulation↩ "],

Don’t expect major changes in content, but rather only minor changes in presentation. Our remodeling will be complete and available online at ModernDive.com by early Summer 2019! In Chapter 8, we explored the process of sampling from a representative sample to build a sampling distribution. The motivation there was to use multiple samples from the same population to visualize and attempt to understand the variability in the statistic from one sample to another. Furthermore, recall our concepts and terminology related to sampling from the beginning of Chapter 8: Generally speaking, we learned that if the sampling of a sample of size \\(n\\) is done at random, then the resulting sample is unbiased and representative of the population, thus any result based on the sample can generalize to the population, and hence the point estimate/sample statistic computed from this sample is a “good guess” of the unknown population parameter of interest Specific to the bowl, we learned that if we properly mix the balls first thereby ensuring the randomness of samples extracted using the shovel with \\(n=50\\) slots, then the contents of the shovel will “look like” the contents of the bowl, thus any results based on the sample of \\(n=50\\) balls can generalize to the large bowl of \\(N=2400\\) balls, and hence the sample proportion red \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the \\(n=50\\) balls in the shovel is a “good guess” of the true population proportion red \\(p\\) of the \\(N=2400\\) balls in the bowl. We emphasize that we used a point estimate/sample statistic, in this case the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\), to estimate the unknown value of the population parameter, in this case the population proportion \\(p\\). In other words, we are using the sample to infer about the population. We can however consider inferential situations other than just those involving proportions. We present a wide array of such scenarios in Table 9.1. In all 7 cases, the point estimate/sample statistic estimates the unknown population parameter. It does so by computing summary statistics based on a sample of size \\(n\\). TABLE 9.1: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Notation. 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) or \\(\\overline{x}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) 5 Population regression slope \\(\\beta_1\\) Sample regression slope \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) or \\(b_1\\) 6 Population regression intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) Sample regression intercept \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) or \\(b_0\\) We’ll cover the first four scenarios in this chapter on confidence intervals and the following one on hypothesis testing: Scenario 2 about means. Ex: the average age of pennies. Scenario 3 about differences in proportions between two groups. Ex: the difference in high school completion rates for Canadians vs non-Canadians. We call this a situation of two-sample inference. Scenario 4 is similar to 3, but its about the means of two groups. Ex: the difference in average test scores for the morning section of a class versus the afternoon section of a class. This is another situation of two-sample inference. In Chapter 11 on inference for regression, we’ll cover Scenarios 5 &amp; 6 about the regression line. In particular we’ll see that the fitted regression line from Chapter 6 on basic regression, \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\), is in fact an estimate of some true population regression line \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x\\) based on a sample of \\(n\\) pairs of points \\((x, y)\\). Ex: Recall our sample of \\(n=463\\) instructors at the UT Austin from the evals data set in Chapter 6. Based on the results of the fitted regression model of teaching score with beauty score as an explanatory/predictor variable, what can we say about this relationship for all instructors, not just those at the UT Austin? In contrast to these, Scenario 7 involves a measure of spread: the standard deviation. Does the spread/variability of a sample match the spread/variability of the population? However, we leave this topic for a more intermediate course on statistical inference. In most cases, we don’t have the population values as we did with the bowl of balls. We only have a single sample of data from a larger population. We’d like to be able to make some reasonable guesses about population parameters using that single sample to create a range of plausible values for a population parameter. This range of plausible values is known as a confidence interval and will be the focus of this chapter. And how do we use a single sample to get some idea of how other samples might vary in terms of their statistic values? One common way this is done is via a process known as bootstrapping that will be the focus of the beginning sections of this chapter. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(janitor) library(moderndive) library(infer) 9.1 Bootstrapping 9.1.1 Data explanation The moderndive package contains a sample of 40 pennies collected and minted in the United States. Let’s explore this sample data first: pennies_sample # A tibble: 40 x 2 year age_in_2011 &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 2005 6 2 1981 30 3 1977 34 4 1992 19 5 2005 6 6 2006 5 7 2000 11 8 1992 19 9 1988 23 10 1996 15 # … with 30 more rows The pennies_sample data frame has rows corresponding to a single penny with two variables: year of minting as shown on the penny and age_in_2011 giving the years the penny had been in circulation from 2011 as an integer, e.g. 15, 2, etc. Suppose we are interested in understanding some properties of the mean age of all US pennies from this data collected in 2011. How might we go about that? Let’s begin by understanding some of the properties of pennies_sample using data wrangling from Chapter 4 and data visualization from Chapter 3. 9.1.2 Exploratory data analysis First, let’s visualize the values in this sample as a histogram: ggplot(pennies_sample, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) We see a roughly symmetric distribution here that has quite a few values near 20 years in age with only a few larger than 40 years or smaller than 5 years. If pennies_sample is a representative sample from the population, we’d expect the age of all US pennies collected in 2011 to have a similar shape, a similar spread, and similar measures of central tendency like the mean. So where does the mean value fall for this sample? This point will be known as our point estimate and provides us with a single number that could serve as the guess to what the true population mean age might be. Recall how to find this using the dplyr package: x_bar &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) x_bar # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 25.1 We’ve denoted this sample mean as \\(\\bar{x}\\), which is the standard symbol for denoting the mean of a sample. Our point estimate is, thus, \\(\\bar{x} = 25.1\\). Note that this is just one sample though providing just one guess at the population mean. What if we’d like to have another guess? This should all sound similar to what we did in Chapter 8. There instead of collecting just a single scoop of balls we had many different students use the shovel to scoop different samples of red and white balls. We then calculated a sample statistic (the sample proportion) from each sample. But, we don’t have a population to pull from here with the pennies. We only have this one sample. The process of bootstrapping allows us to use a single sample to generate many different samples that will act as our way of approximating a sampling distribution using a created bootstrap distribution instead. We will pull ourselves up from our bootstraps using a single sample (pennies_sample) to get an idea of the grander sampling distribution. 9.1.3 The Bootstrapping Process Bootstrapping uses a process of sampling with replacement from our original sample to create new bootstrap samples of the same size as our original sample. We can again make use of the rep_sample_n() function to explore what one such bootstrap sample would look like. Remember that we are randomly sampling from the original sample here with replacement and that we always use the same sample size for the bootstrap samples as the size of the original sample (pennies_sample). bootstrap_sample1 &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 40, replace = TRUE, reps = 1) bootstrap_sample1 # A tibble: 40 x 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate year age_in_2011 &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 1983 28 2 1 2000 11 3 1 2004 7 4 1 1981 30 5 1 1993 18 6 1 2006 5 7 1 1981 30 8 1 2004 7 9 1 1992 19 10 1 1994 17 # … with 30 more rows Let’s visualize what this new bootstrap sample looks like: ggplot(bootstrap_sample1, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) We now have another sample from what we could assume comes from the population of interest. We can similarly calculate the sample mean of this bootstrap sample, called a bootstrap statistic. bootstrap_sample1 %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 23.2 We can see that this sample mean is smaller than the x_bar value we calculated earlier for the pennies_sample data. We’ll come back to analyzing the different bootstrap statistic values shortly. Let’s recap what was done to get to this bootstrap sample using a tactile explanation: First, pretend that each of the 40 values of age_in_2011 in pennies_sample were written on a small piece of paper. Recall that these values were 6, 30, 34, 19, 6, etc. Now, put the 40 small pieces of paper into a receptacle such as a baseball cap. Shake up the pieces of paper. Draw “at random” from the cap to select one piece of paper. Write down the value on this piece of paper. Say that it is 28. Now, place this piece of paper containing 28 back into the cap. Draw “at random” again from the cap to select a piece of paper. Note that this is the sampling with replacement part since you may draw 28 again. Repeat this process until you have drawn 40 pieces of paper and written down the values on these 40 pieces of paper. Completing this repetition produces ONE bootstrap sample. If you look at the values in bootstrap_sample1, you can see how this process plays out. We originally drew 28, then we drew 11, then 7, and so on. Of course, we didn’t actually use pieces of paper and a cap here. We just had the computer perform this process for us to produce bootstrap_sample1 using rep_sample_n() with replace = TRUE set. The process of sampling with replacement is how we can use the original sample to take a guess as to what other values in the population may be. Sometimes in these bootstrap samples, we will select lots of larger values from the original sample, sometimes we will select lots of smaller values, and most frequently we will select values that are near the center of the sample. Let’s explore what the distribution of values of age_in_2011 for six different bootstrap samples looks like to further understand this variability. six_bootstrap_samples &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 40, replace = TRUE, reps = 6) ggplot(six_bootstrap_samples, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ replicate) We can also look at the six different means using dplyr syntax: six_bootstrap_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) # A tibble: 6 x 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 23.6 2 2 24.1 3 3 25.2 4 4 23.1 5 5 24.0 6 6 24.7 Instead of doing this six times, we could do it 1000 times and then look at the distribution of stat across all 1000 of the replicates. This sets the stage for the infer R package (Bray et al. 2018) that was created to help users perform statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using verbs similar to what you’ve seen with dplyr. We’ll walk through setting up each of the infer verbs for confidence intervals using this pennies_sample example, while also explaining the purpose of the verbs in a general framework. 9.2 The infer package for statistical inference The infer package makes great use of the %&gt;% to create a pipeline for statistical inference. The goal of the package is to provide a way for its users to explain the computational process of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using the code as a guide. The verbs build in order here, so you’ll want to start with specify() and then continue through the others as needed. 9.2.1 Specify variables The specify() function is used primarily to choose which variables will be the focus of the statistical inference. In addition, a setting of which variable will act as the explanatory and which acts as the response variable is done here. For proportion problems similar to those in Chapter 8, we can also give which of the different levels we would like to have as a success. We’ll see further examples of these options in this chapter, Chapter 10, and in Appendix B. To begin to create a confidence interval for the population mean age of US pennies in 2011, we start by using specify() to choose which variable in our pennies_sample data we’d like to work with. This can be done in one of two ways: Using the response argument: pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) Response: age_in_2011 (integer) # A tibble: 40 x 1 age_in_2011 &lt;int&gt; 1 6 2 30 3 34 4 19 5 6 6 5 7 11 8 19 9 23 10 15 # … with 30 more rows Using formula notation: pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = age_in_2011 ~ NULL) Response: age_in_2011 (integer) # A tibble: 40 x 1 age_in_2011 &lt;int&gt; 1 6 2 30 3 34 4 19 5 6 6 5 7 11 8 19 9 23 10 15 # … with 30 more rows Note that the formula notation uses the common R methodology to include the response \\(y\\) variable on the left of the ~ and the explanatory \\(x\\) variable on the right of the “tilde.” Recall that you used this notation frequently with the lm() function in Chapters 6 and 7 when fitting regression models. Either notation works just fine, but a preference is usually given here for the formula notation to further build on the ideas from earlier chapters. 9.2.2 Generate replicates After specify()ing the variables we’d like in our inferential analysis, we next feed that into the generate() verb. The generate() verb’s main argument is reps, which is used to give how many different repetitions one would like to perform. Another argument here is type, which is automatically determined by the kinds of variables passed into specify(). We can also be explicit and set this type to be type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;. This type argument will be further used in hypothesis testing in Chapter 10 as well. Make sure to check out ?generate to see the options here and use the ? operator to better understand other verbs as well. Let’s generate() 1000 bootstrap samples: thousand_bootstrap_samples &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) Setting `type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;` in `generate()`. We can use the dplyr count() function to help us understand what the thousand_bootstrap_samples data frame looks like: thousand_bootstrap_samples %&gt;% count(replicate) # A tibble: 1,000 x 2 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate n &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 40 2 2 40 3 3 40 4 4 40 5 5 40 6 6 40 7 7 40 8 8 40 9 9 40 10 10 40 # … with 990 more rows Notice that each replicate has 40 entries here. Now that we have 1000 different bootstrap samples, our next step is to calculate the bootstrap statistics for each sample. 9.2.3 Calculate summary statistics After generate()ing many different samples, we next want to condense those samples down into a single statistic for each replicated sample. As seen in the diagram, the calculate() function is helpful here. As we did at the beginning of this chapter, we now want to calculate the mean age_in_2011 for each bootstrap sample. To do so, we use the stat argument and set it to &quot;mean&quot; below. The stat argument has a variety of different options here and we will see further examples of this throughout the remaining chapters. bootstrap_distribution &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) Setting `type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;` in `generate()`. bootstrap_distribution # A tibble: 1,000 x 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 26.5 2 2 25.4 3 3 26.0 4 4 26 5 5 25.2 6 6 29.0 7 7 22.8 8 8 26.4 9 9 24.9 10 10 28.1 # … with 990 more rows We see that the resulting data has 1000 rows and 2 columns corresponding to the 1000 replicates and the mean for each bootstrap sample. Observed statistic / point estimate calculations Just as group_by() %&gt;% summarize() produces a useful workflow in dplyr, we can also use specify() %&gt;% calculate() to compute summary measures on our original sample data. It’s often helpful both in confidence interval calculations, but also in hypothesis testing to identify what the corresponding statistic is in the original data. For our example on penny age, we computed above a value of x_bar using the summarize() verb in dplyr: pennies_sample %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 25.1 This can also be done by skipping the generate() step in the pipeline feeding specify() directly into calculate(): pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 25.1 This shortcut will be particularly useful when the calculation of the observed statistic is tricky to do using dplyr alone. This is particularly the case when working with more than one variable as will be seen in Chapter 10. 9.2.4 Visualize the results The visualize() verb provides a simple way to view the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the stat variable values. It has many other arguments that one can use as well including the shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize() The shape of this resulting distribution may look familiar to you. It resembles the well-known normal (bell-shaped) curve. The following diagram recaps the infer pipeline for creating a bootstrap distribution. 9.3 Now to confidence intervals Definition: Confidence Interval A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values for a parameter. It depends on a specified confidence level with higher confidence levels corresponding to wider confidence intervals and lower confidence levels corresponding to narrower confidence intervals. Common confidence levels include 90%, 95%, and 99%. Usually we don’t just begin sections with a definition, but confidence intervals are simple to define and play an important role in the sciences and any field that uses data. You can think of a confidence interval as playing the role of a net when fishing. Instead of just trying to catch a fish with a single spear (estimating an unknown parameter by using a single point estimate/statistic), we can use a net to try to provide a range of possible locations for the fish (use a range of possible values based around our statistic to make a plausible guess as to the location of the parameter). The bootstrapping process will provide bootstrap statistics that have a bootstrap distribution with center at (or extremely close to) the mean of the original sample. This can be seen by giving the observed statistic obs_stat argument the value of the point estimate x_bar. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = x_bar) We can also compute the mean of the bootstrap distribution of means to see how it compares to x_bar: bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% summarize(mean_of_means = mean(stat)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 mean_of_means &lt;dbl&gt; 1 25.1 In this case, we can see that the bootstrap distribution provides us a guess as to what the variability in different sample means may look like only using the original sample as our guide. We can quantify this variability in the form of a 95% confidence interval in a couple different ways. 9.3.1 The percentile method One way to calculate a range of plausible values for the unknown mean age of coins in 2011 is to use the middle 95% of the bootstrap_distribution to determine our endpoints. Our endpoints are thus at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. This can be done with infer using the get_ci() function. (You can also use the conf_int() or get_confidence_interval() functions here as they are aliases that work the exact same way.) bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 21.0 29.3 These options are the default values for level and type so we can also just do: percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci() percentile_ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 21.0 29.3 Using the percentile method, our range of plausible values for the mean age of US pennies in circulation in 2011 is 20.972 years to 29.252 years. We can use the visualize() function to view this using the endpoints and direction arguments, setting direction to &quot;between&quot; (between the values) and endpoints to be those stored with name percentile_ci. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = percentile_ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) You can see that 95% of the data stored in the stat variable in bootstrap_distribution falls between the two endpoints with 2.5% to the left outside of the shading and 2.5% to the right outside of the shading. The cut-off points that provide our range are shown with the darker lines. 9.3.2 The standard error method If the bootstrap distribution is close to symmetric and bell-shaped, we can also use a shortcut formula for determining the lower and upper endpoints of the confidence interval. This is done by using the formula \\(\\bar{x} \\pm (multiplier * SE),\\) where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is our original sample mean and \\(SE\\) stands for standard error and corresponds to the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution. The value of \\(multiplier\\) here is the appropriate percentile of the standard normal distribution. These are automatically calculated when level is provided with level = 0.95 being the default. (95% of the values in a standard normal distribution fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, so \\(multiplier = 1.96\\) for level = 0.95, for example.) As mentioned, this formula assumes that the bootstrap distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. This is often the case with bootstrap distributions, especially those in which the original distribution of the sample is not highly skewed. Definition: standard error The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The variability of the sampling distribution may be approximated by the variability of the bootstrap distribution. Traditional theory-based methodologies for inference also have formulas for standard errors, assuming some conditions are met. This \\(\\bar{x} \\pm (multiplier * SE)\\) formula is implemented in the get_ci() function as shown with our pennies problem using the bootstrap distribution’s variability as an approximation for the sampling distribution’s variability. We’ll see more on this approximation shortly. Note that the center of the confidence interval (the point_estimate) must be provided for the standard error confidence interval. standard_error_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci(type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = x_bar) standard_error_ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 lower upper &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 21.0 29.3 bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = standard_error_ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that both methods produce nearly identical confidence intervals with the percentile method being \\([20.97, 29.25]\\) and the standard error method being \\([20.97, 29.28]\\). 9.4 Comparing bootstrap and sampling distributions To help build up the idea of a confidence interval, we weren’t completely honest in our initial discussion. The pennies_sample data frame represents a sample from a larger number of pennies stored as pennies in the moderndive package. The pennies data frame (also in the moderndive package) contains 800 rows of data and two columns pertaining to the same variables as pennies_sample. Let’s begin by understanding some of the properties of the age_by_2011 variable in the pennies data frame. ggplot(pennies, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) pennies %&gt;% summarize(mean_age = mean(age_in_2011), median_age = median(age_in_2011)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 mean_age median_age &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 21.2 20 We see that pennies is slightly right-skewed with the mean being pulled towards the upper outliers. Recall that pennies_sample was more symmetric than pennies. In fact, it actually exhibited some left-skew as we compare the mean and median values. ggplot(pennies_sample, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) pennies_sample %&gt;% summarize(mean_age = mean(age_in_2011), median_age = median(age_in_2011)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 mean_age median_age &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 25.1 25.5 Sampling distribution Let’s assume that pennies represents our population of interest. We can then create a sampling distribution for the population mean age of pennies, denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\), using the rep_sample_n() function seen in Chapter 8. First we will create 1000 samples from the pennies data frame. thousand_samples &lt;- pennies %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 40, reps = 1000, replace = FALSE) When creating a sampling distribution, we do not replace the items when we create each sample. This is in contrast to the bootstrap distribution. It’s important to remember that the sampling distribution is sampling without replacement from the population to better understand sample-to-sample variability, whereas the bootstrap distribution is sampling with replacement from our original sample to better understand potential sample-to-sample variability. After sampling from pennies 1000 times, we next want to compute the mean age for each of the 1000 samples: sampling_distribution &lt;- thousand_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) ggplot(sampling_distribution, aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = &quot;salmon&quot;, color = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 9.1: Sampling distribution for n=40 samples of pennies We can also examine the variability in this sampling distribution by calculating the standard deviation of the stat column. Remember that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the standard error, frequently denoted as se. sampling_distribution %&gt;% summarize(se = sd(stat)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 se &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2.01 Bootstrap distribution Let’s now see how the shape of the bootstrap distribution compares to that of the sampling distribution. We’ll shade the bootstrap distribution blue to further assist with remembering which is which. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(bins = 10, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% summarize(se = sd(stat)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 se &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2.12 Notice that while the standard deviations are similar, the center of the sampling distribution and the bootstrap distribution differ: sampling_distribution %&gt;% summarize(mean_of_sampling_means = mean(stat)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 mean_of_sampling_means &lt;dbl&gt; 1 21.2 bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% summarize(mean_of_bootstrap_means = mean(stat)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 mean_of_bootstrap_means &lt;dbl&gt; 1 25.1 Since the bootstrap distribution is centered at the original sample mean, it doesn’t necessarily provide a good estimate of the overall population mean \\(\\mu\\). Let’s calculate the mean of age_in_2011 for the pennies data frame to see how it compares to the mean of the sampling distribution and the mean of the bootstrap distribution. pennies %&gt;% summarize(overall_mean = mean(age_in_2011)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 overall_mean &lt;dbl&gt; 1 21.2 Notice that this value matches up well with the mean of the sampling distribution. This is actually an artifact of the Central Limit Theorem introduced in Chapter 8. The mean of the sampling distribution is expected to be the mean of the overall population. The unfortunate fact though is that we don’t know the population mean in nearly all circumstances. The motivation of presenting it here was to show that the theory behind the Central Limit Theorem works using the tools you’ve worked with so far using the ggplot2, dplyr, moderndive, and infer packages. If we aren’t able to use the sample mean as a good guess for the population mean, how should we best go about estimating what the population mean may be if we can only select samples from the population. We’ve now come full circle and can discuss the underpinnings of the confidence interval and ways to interpret it. 9.5 Interpreting the confidence interval As shown above in Subsection 9.3.1, one range of plausible values for the population mean age of pennies in 2011, denoted by \\(\\mu\\), is \\([20.97, 29.25]\\). Recall that this confidence interval is based on bootstrapping using pennies_sample. Note that the mean of pennies (21.152) does fall in this confidence interval. If we had a different sample of size 40 and constructed a confidence interval using the same method, would we be guaranteed that it contained the population parameter value as well? Let’s try it out: pennies_sample2 &lt;- pennies %&gt;% sample_n(size = 40) Note the use of the sample_n() function in the dplyr package here. This does the same thing as rep_sample_n(reps = 1) but omits the extra replicate column. We next create an infer pipeline to generate a percentile-based 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\): percentile_ci2 &lt;- pennies_sample2 %&gt;% specify(formula = age_in_2011 ~ NULL) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) %&gt;% get_ci() Setting `type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;` in `generate()`. percentile_ci2 # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 18.4 25.3 This new confidence interval also contains the value of \\(\\mu\\). Let’s further investigate by repeating this process 100 times to get 100 different confidence intervals derived from 100 different samples of pennies. Each sample will have size of 40 just as the original sample. We will plot each of these confidence intervals as horizontal lines. We will also show a line corresponding to the known population value of 21.152 years. Of the 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \\(n = 40\\), 96 of them captured the population mean \\(\\mu = 21.152\\), whereas 4 of them did not include it. If we repeated this process of building confidence intervals more times with more samples, we’d expect 95% of them to contain the population mean. In other words, the procedure we have used to generate confidence intervals is “95% reliable” in that we can expect it to include the true population parameter 95% of the time if the process is repeated. To further accentuate this point, let’s perform a similar procedure using 90% confidence intervals instead. This time we will use the standard error method instead of the percentile method for computing the confidence intervals. Of the 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \\(n = 40\\), 87 of them captured the population mean \\(\\mu = 21.152\\), whereas 13 of them did not include it. Repeating this process for more samples would result in us getting closer and closer to 90% of the confidence intervals including the true value. It is common to say while interpreting a confidence interval to be “95% confident” or “90% confident” that the true value falls within the range of the specified confidence interval. We will use this “confident” language throughout the rest of this chapter, but remember that it has more to do with a measure of reliability of the building process. Back to our pennies example After this elaboration on what the level corresponds to in a confidence interval, let’s conclude by providing an interpretation of the original confidence interval result we found in Subsection 9.3.1. Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true mean age of pennies in circulation in 2011 is between 20.972 and 29.252 years. This level of confidence is based on the percentile-based method including the true mean 95% of the time if many different samples (not just the one we used) were collected and confidence intervals were created. 9.6 Example: One proportion Let’s revisit our exercise of trying to estimate the proportion of red balls in the bowl from Chapter 8. We are now interested in determining a confidence interval for population parameter \\(p\\), the proportion of balls that are red out of the total \\(N = 2400\\) red and white balls. We will use the first sample reported from Ilyas and Yohan in Subsection 8.1.3 for our point estimate. They observed 21 red balls out of the 50 in their shovel. This data is stored in the tactile_shovel1 data frame in the moderndive package. tactile_shovel1 # A tibble: 50 x 1 color &lt;chr&gt; 1 red 2 red 3 white 4 red 5 white 6 red 7 red 8 white 9 red 10 white # … with 40 more rows 9.6.1 Observed Statistic To compute the proportion that are red in this data we can use the specify() %&gt;% calculate() workflow. Note the use of the success argument here to clarify which of the two colors &quot;red&quot; or &quot;white&quot; we are interested in. p_hat &lt;- tactile_shovel1 %&gt;% specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = &quot;red&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) p_hat # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.42 9.6.2 Bootstrap distribution Next we want to calculate many different bootstrap samples and their corresponding bootstrap statistic (the proportion of red balls). We’ve done 1000 in the past, but let’s go up to 10,000 now to better see the resulting distribution. Recall that this is done by including a generate() function call in the middle of our pipeline: tactile_shovel1 %&gt;% specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = &quot;red&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) Setting `type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;` in `generate()`. This results in 50 rows for each of the 10,000 replicates. Lastly, we finish the infer pipeline by adding back in the calculate() step. bootstrap_props &lt;- tactile_shovel1 %&gt;% specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = &quot;red&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) Let’s visualize() what the resulting bootstrap distribution looks like as a histogram. We’ve adjusted the number of bins here as well to better see the resulting shape. bootstrap_props %&gt;% visualize(bins = 25) We see that the resulting distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped so it doesn’t much matter which confidence interval method we choose. Let’s use the standard error method to create a 95% confidence interval. standard_error_ci &lt;- bootstrap_props %&gt;% get_ci(type = &quot;se&quot;, level = 0.95, point_estimate = p_hat) standard_error_ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 lower upper &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.284 0.556 bootstrap_props %&gt;% visualize(bins = 25, endpoints = standard_error_ci) We are 95% confident that the true proportion of red balls in the bowl is between 0.284 and 0.556. This level of confidence is based on the standard error-based method including the true proportion 95% of the time if many different samples (not just the one we used) were collected and confidence intervals were created. 9.6.3 Theory-based confidence intervals When the bootstrap distribution has the nice symmetric, bell shape that we saw in the red balls example above, we can also use a formula to quantify the standard error. This provides another way to compute a confidence interval, but is a little more tedious and mathematical. The steps are outlined below. We’ve also shown how we can use the confidence interval (CI) interpretation in this case as well to support your understanding of this tricky concept. Procedure for building a theory-based CI for \\(p\\) To construct a theory-based confidence interval for \\(p\\), the unknown true population proportion we Collect a sample of size \\(n\\) Compute \\(\\widehat{p}\\) Compute the standard error \\[\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] Compute the margin of error \\[\\text{MoE} = 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE} = 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] Compute both end points of the confidence interval: The lower end point lower_ci: \\[\\widehat{p} - \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] The upper end point upper_ci: \\[\\widehat{p} + \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} + 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} + 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] Alternatively, you can succinctly summarize a 95% confidence interval for \\(p\\) using the \\(\\pm\\) symbol: \\[ \\widehat{p} \\pm \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}} \\] Confidence intervals based on 33 tactile samples Let’s load the tactile sampling data for the 33 groups from Chapter 8. Recall this data was saved in the tactile_prop_red data frame included in the moderndive package. tactile_prop_red Let’s now apply the above procedure for constructing confidence intervals for \\(p\\) using the data saved in tactile_prop_red by adding/modifying new columns using the dplyr package data wrangling tools seen in Chapter 4: Rename prop_red to p_hat, the official name of the sample proportion Make explicit the sample size n of \\(n=50\\) the standard error SE the margin of error MoE the left endpoint of the confidence interval lower_ci the right endpoint of the confidence interval upper_ci conf_ints &lt;- tactile_prop_red %&gt;% rename(p_hat = prop_red) %&gt;% mutate( n = 50, SE = sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n), MoE = 1.96 * SE, lower_ci = p_hat - MoE, upper_ci = p_hat + MoE ) conf_ints TABLE 9.2: 33 confidence intervals from 33 tactile samples of size n=50 group red_balls p_hat n SE MoE lower_ci upper_ci Ilyas, Yohan 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Morgan, Terrance 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Martin, Thomas 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Clark, Frank 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Riddhi, Karina 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Andrew, Tyler 19 0.38 50 0.069 0.135 0.245 0.515 Julia 19 0.38 50 0.069 0.135 0.245 0.515 Rachel, Lauren 11 0.22 50 0.059 0.115 0.105 0.335 Daniel, Caroline 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Josh, Maeve 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Emily, Emily 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Conrad, Emily 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Oliver, Erik 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Isabel, Nam 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 X, Claire 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Cindy, Kimberly 20 0.40 50 0.069 0.136 0.264 0.536 Kevin, James 11 0.22 50 0.059 0.115 0.105 0.335 Nam, Isabelle 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Harry, Yuko 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Yuki, Eileen 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Ramses 23 0.46 50 0.070 0.138 0.322 0.598 Joshua, Elizabeth, Stanley 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Siobhan, Jane 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Jack, Will 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Caroline, Katie 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Griffin, Y 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Kaitlin, Jordan 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Ella, Garrett 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Julie, Hailin 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Katie, Caroline 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Mallory, Damani, Melissa 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Katie 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Francis, Vignesh 19 0.38 50 0.069 0.135 0.245 0.515 Let’s plot: These 33 confidence intervals for \\(p\\): from lower_ci to upper_ci The true population proportion \\(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\\) with a red vertical line FIGURE 9.2: 33 confidence intervals based on 33 tactile samples of size n=50 We see that: In 31 cases, the confidence intervals “capture” the true \\(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\\) In 2 cases, the confidence intervals do not “capture” the true \\(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\\) Thus, the confidence intervals capture the true proportion $31 / 33 = 93.939% of the time using this theory-based methodology. Confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples Let’s say however, we repeated the above 100 times, not tactilely, but virtually. Let’s do this only 100 times instead of 1000 like we did before so that the results can fit on the screen. Again, the steps for compute a 95% confidence interval for \\(p\\) are: Collect a sample of size \\(n = 50\\) as we did in Chapter 8 Compute \\(\\widehat{p}\\): the sample proportion red of these \\(n=50\\) balls Compute the standard error \\(\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) Compute the margin of error \\(\\text{MoE} = 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE} = 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) Compute both end points of the confidence interval: lower_ci: \\(\\widehat{p} - \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) upper_ci: \\(\\widehat{p} + \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} + 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} +1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) Run the following three steps, being sure to View() the resulting data frame after each step so you can convince yourself of what’s going on: # First: Take 100 virtual samples of n=50 balls virtual_samples &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 100) # Second: For each virtual sample compute the proportion red virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) # Third: Compute the 95% confidence interval as above virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_prop_red %&gt;% rename(p_hat = prop_red) %&gt;% mutate( n = 50, SE = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n), MoE = 1.96 * SE, lower_ci = p_hat - MoE, upper_ci = p_hat + MoE ) Here are the results: FIGURE 9.3: 100 confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples of size n=50 We see that of our 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \\(n=50\\), 96 of them captured the true \\(p = 900/2400\\), whereas 4 of them missed. As we create more and more confidence intervals based on more and more samples, about 95% of these intervals will capture. In other words our procedure is “95% reliable.” Theoretical methods like this have largely been used in the past since we didn’t have the computing power to perform the simulation-based methods such as bootstrapping. They are still commonly used though and if the normality assumptions are met, they can provide a nice option for finding confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests as we will see in Chapter 10. 9.7 Example: Comparing two proportions If you see someone else yawn, are you more likely to yawn? In an episode of the show Mythbusters, they tested the myth that yawning is contagious. The snippet from the show is available to view in the United States on the Discovery Network website here. More information about the episode is also available on IMDb here. Fifty adults who thought they were being considered for an appearance on the show were interviewed by a show recruiter (“confederate”) who either yawned or did not. Participants then sat by themselves in a large van and were asked to wait. While in the van, the Mythbusters watched via hidden camera to see if the unaware participants yawned. The data frame containing the results is available at mythbusters_yawn in the moderndive package. Let’s check it out. mythbusters_yawn # A tibble: 50 x 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 seed yes 2 2 control yes 3 3 seed no 4 4 seed yes 5 5 seed no 6 6 control no 7 7 seed yes 8 8 control no 9 9 control no 10 10 seed no # … with 40 more rows The participant ID is stored in the subj variable with values of 1 to 50. The group variable is either &quot;seed&quot; for when a confederate was trying to influence the participant or &quot;control&quot; if a confederate did not interact with the participant. The yawn variable is either &quot;yes&quot; if the participant yawned or &quot;no&quot; if the participant did not yawn. We can use the janitor package to get a glimpse into this data in a table format: mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% tabyl(group, yawn) %&gt;% adorn_percentages() %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting() %&gt;% # To show original counts adorn_ns() group no yes control 75.0% (12) 25.0% (4) seed 70.6% (24) 29.4% (10) We are interested in comparing the proportion of those that yawned after seeing a seed versus those that yawned with no seed interaction. We’d like to see if the difference between these two proportions is significantly larger than 0. If so, we’d have evidence to support the claim that yawning is contagious based on this study. In looking over this problem, we can make note of some important details to include in our infer pipeline: We are calling a success having a yawn value of &quot;yes&quot;. Our response variable will always correspond to the variable used in the success so the response variable is yawn. The explanatory variable is the other variable of interest here: group. To summarize, we are looking to see the examine the relationship between yawning and whether or not the participant saw a seed yawn or not. 9.7.1 Compute the point estimate mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group) Error: A level of the response variable `yawn` needs to be specified for the `success` argument in `specify()`. Note that the success argument must be specified in situations such as this where the response variable has only two levels. mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) Response: yawn (factor) Explanatory: group (factor) # A tibble: 50 x 2 yawn group &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 yes seed 2 yes control 3 no seed 4 yes seed 5 no seed 6 no control 7 yes seed 8 no control 9 no control 10 no seed # … with 40 more rows We next want to calculate the statistic of interest for our sample. This corresponds to the difference in the proportion of successes. mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;) Error: Statistic is based on a difference; specify the `order` in which to subtract the levels of the explanatory variable. `order = c(&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;)` means `(&quot;first&quot; - &quot;second&quot;)`. Check `?calculate` for details. We see another error here. To further check to make sure that R knows exactly what we are after, we need to provide the order in which R should subtract these proportions of successes. As the error message states, we’ll want to put &quot;seed&quot; first after c() and then &quot;control&quot;: order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;). Our point estimate is thus calculated: obs_diff &lt;- mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) obs_diff # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0441 This value represents the proportion of those that yawned after seeing a seed yawn (0.2941) minus the proportion of those that yawned with not seeing a seed (0.25). 9.7.2 Bootstrap distribution Our next step in building a confidence interval is to create a bootstrap distribution of statistics (differences in proportions of successes). We saw how it works with both a single variable in computing bootstrap means in Subsection 9.1.3 and in computing bootstrap proportions in Section 9.6, but we haven’t yet worked with bootstrapping involving multiple variables though. In the infer package, bootstrapping with multiple variables means that each row is potentially resampled. Let’s investigate this by looking at the first few rows of mythbusters_yawn: head(mythbusters_yawn) # A tibble: 6 x 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 seed yes 2 2 control yes 3 3 seed no 4 4 seed yes 5 5 seed no 6 6 control no When we bootstrap this data, we are potentially pulling the subject’s readings multiple times. Thus, we could see the entries of &quot;seed&quot; for group and &quot;no&quot; for yawn together in a new row in a bootstrap sample. This is further seen by exploring the sample_n() function in dplyr on this smaller 6 row data frame comprised of head(mythbusters_yawn). The sample_n() function can perform this bootstrapping procedure and is similar to the rep_sample_n() function in infer, except that it is not repeated but rather only performs one sample with or without replacement. set.seed(2019) head(mythbusters_yawn) %&gt;% sample_n(size = 6, replace = TRUE) # A tibble: 6 x 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 5 seed no 2 5 seed no 3 2 control yes 4 4 seed yes 5 1 seed yes 6 1 seed yes We can see that in this bootstrap sample generated from the first six rows of mythbusters_yawn, we have some rows repeated. The same is true when we perform the generate() step in infer as done below. bootstrap_distribution &lt;- mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) Setting `type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;` in `generate()`. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(bins = 20) This distribution is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped but isn’t quite there. Let’s use the percentile-based method to compute a 95% confidence interval for the true difference in the proportion of those that yawn with and without a seed presented. The arguments are explicitly listed here but remember they are the defaults and simply get_ci() can be used. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci(type = &quot;percentile&quot;, level = 0.95) # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.219 0.293 The confidence interval shown here includes the value of 0. We’ll see in Chapter 10 further what this means in terms of this difference being statistically significant or not, but let’s examine a bit here first. The range of plausible values for the difference in the proportion of that that yawned with and without a seed is between -0.219 and 0.293. Therefore, we are not sure which proportion is larger. Some of the bootstrap statistics showed the proportion without a seed to be higher and others showed the proportion with a seed to be higher. If the confidence interval was entirely above zero, we would be relatively sure (about “95% confident”) that the seed group had a higher proportion of yawning than the control group. Note that this all relates to the importance of denoting the order argument in the calculate() function. Since we specified &quot;seed&quot; and then &quot;control&quot; positive values for the statistic correspond to the &quot;seed&quot; proportion being higher, whereas negative values correspond to the &quot;control&quot; group being higher. We, therefore, have evidence via this confidence interval suggesting that the conclusion from the Mythbusters show that “yawning is contagious” being “confirmed” is not statistically appropriate.

We saw some of the main concepts of hypothesis testing introduced in Chapters 8 and 9.

There was one general framework that applies to all confidence intervals and we elaborated on this using the infer package pipeline in Chapter 9. The specifics may change slightly for each variation, but the important idea is to understand the general framework so that you can apply it to more specific problems. We believe that this approach is much better in the long-term than teaching you specific tests and confidence intervals rigorously.

We recommend that you carefully review these examples as they also cover how the general frameworks apply to traditional normal-based methodologies like the \\(t\\)-test and normal-theory confidence intervals.

An important and time-saving skill is to ALWAYS do exploratory data analysis using dplyr and ggplot2 before thinking about running a hypothesis test. Let’s look at such an example selecting a sample of flights traveling to Boston and to San Francisco from New York City in the flights data frame in the nycflights13 package. (We will remove flights with missing data first using na.omit and then sample 100 flights going to each of the two airports.) bos_sfo &lt;- flights %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% filter(dest %in% c(&quot;BOS&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;)) %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% sample_n(100) Suppose we were interested in seeing if the air_time to SFO in San Francisco was statistically greater than the air_time to BOS in Boston. As suggested, let’s begin with some exploratory data analysis to get a sense for how the two variables of air_time and dest relate for these two destination airports: bos_sfo_summary &lt;- bos_sfo %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% summarize(mean_time = mean(air_time), sd_time = sd(air_time)) bos_sfo_summary # A tibble: 2 x 3 dest mean_time sd_time &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 BOS 39.0 4.51 2 SFO 349. 18.7 Looking at these results, we can clearly see that SFO air_time is much larger than BOS air_time. The standard deviation is also extremely informative here. Learning check (LC10.1) Could we make the same type of immediate conclusion that SFO had a statistically greater air_time if, say, its corresponding standard deviation was 200 minutes? What about 100 minutes? Explain. To further understand just how different the air_time variable is for BOS and SFO, let’s look at a boxplot: ggplot(data = bos_sfo, mapping = aes(x = dest, y = air_time)) + geom_boxplot() Since there is no overlap at all, we can conclude that the air_time for San Francisco flights is statistically greater (at any level of significance) than the air_time for Boston flights. This is a clear example of not needing to do anything more than some simple exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics and data visualization to get an appropriate inferential conclusion. This is one reason why you should ALWAYS investigate the sample data first using dplyr and ggplot2 via exploratory data analysis. As you get more and more practice with hypothesis testing, you’ll be better able to determine in many cases whether or not the results will be statistically significant. There are circumstances where it is difficult to tell, but you should always try to make a guess FIRST about significance after you have completed your data exploration and before you actually begin the inferential techniques. 10.2 Basics of hypothesis testing In a hypothesis test, we will use data from a sample to help us decide between two competing hypotheses about a population. We make these hypotheses more concrete by specifying them in terms of at least one population parameter of interest. We refer to the competing claims about the population as the null hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_0\\), and the alternative (or research) hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_a\\). The roles of these two hypotheses are NOT interchangeable. The claim for which we seek significant evidence is assigned to the alternative hypothesis. The alternative is usually what the experimenter or researcher wants to establish or find evidence for. Usually, the null hypothesis is a claim that there really is “no effect” or “no difference.” In many cases, the null hypothesis represents the status quo or that nothing interesting is happening. We assess the strength of evidence by assuming the null hypothesis is true and determining how unlikely it would be to see sample results/statistics as extreme (or more extreme) as those in the original sample. Hypothesis testing brings about many weird and incorrect notions in the scientific community and society at large. One reason for this is that statistics has traditionally been thought of as this magic box of algorithms and procedures to get to results and this has been readily apparent if you do a Google search of “flowchart statistics hypothesis tests.” There are so many different complex ways to determine which test is appropriate. You’ll see that we don’t need to rely on these complicated series of assumptions and procedures to conduct a hypothesis test any longer. These methods were introduced in a time when computers weren’t powerful. Your cellphone (in 2016) has more power than the computers that sent NASA astronauts to the moon after all. We’ll see that ALL hypothesis tests can be broken down into the following framework given by Allen Downey here: FIGURE 10.1: Hypothesis Testing Framework Before we hop into this framework, we will provide another way to think about hypothesis testing that may be useful. 10.3 Criminal trial analogy We can think of hypothesis testing in the same context as a criminal trial in the United States. A criminal trial in the United States is a familiar situation in which a choice between two contradictory claims must be made. The accuser of the crime must be judged either guilty or not guilty. Under the U.S. system of justice, the individual on trial is initially presumed not guilty. Only STRONG EVIDENCE to the contrary causes the not guilty claim to be rejected in favor of a guilty verdict. The phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” is often used to set the cutoff value for when enough evidence has been given to convict. Theoretically, we should never say “The person is innocent.” but instead “There is not sufficient evidence to show that the person is guilty.” Now let’s compare that to how we look at a hypothesis test. The decision about the population parameter(s) must be judged to follow one of two hypotheses. We initially assume that \\(H_0\\) is true. The null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) will be rejected (in favor of \\(H_a\\)) only if the sample evidence strongly suggests that \\(H_0\\) is false. If the sample does not provide such evidence, \\(H_0\\) will not be rejected. The analogy to “beyond a reasonable doubt” in hypothesis testing is what is known as the significance level. This will be set before conducting the hypothesis test and is denoted as \\(\\alpha\\). Common values for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.1, 0.01, and 0.05. 10.3.1 Two possible conclusions Therefore, we have two possible conclusions with hypothesis testing: Reject \\(H_0\\) Fail to reject \\(H_0\\) Gut instinct says that “Fail to reject \\(H_0\\)” should say “Accept \\(H_0\\)” but this technically is not correct. Accepting \\(H_0\\) is the same as saying that a person is innocent. We cannot show that a person is innocent; we can only say that there was not enough substantial evidence to find the person guilty. When you run a hypothesis test, you are the jury of the trial. You decide whether there is enough evidence to convince yourself that \\(H_a\\) is true (“the person is guilty”) or that there was not enough evidence to convince yourself \\(H_a\\) is true (“the person is not guilty”). You must convince yourself (using statistical arguments) which hypothesis is the correct one given the sample information. Important note: Therefore, DO NOT WRITE “Accept \\(H_0\\)” any time you conduct a hypothesis test. Instead write “Fail to reject \\(H_0\\).” 10.4 Types of errors in hypothesis testing Unfortunately, just as a jury or a judge can make an incorrect decision in regards to a criminal trial by reaching the wrong verdict, there is some chance we will reach the wrong conclusion via a hypothesis test about a population parameter. As with criminal trials, this comes from the fact that we don’t have complete information, but rather a sample from which to try to infer about a population. The possible erroneous conclusions in a criminal trial are an innocent person is convicted (found guilty) or a guilty person is set free (found not guilty). The possible errors in a hypothesis test are rejecting \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is true (Type I Error) or failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is false (Type II Error). The risk of error is the price researchers pay for basing an inference about a population on a sample. With any reasonable sample-based procedure, there is some chance that a Type I error will be made and some chance that a Type II error will occur. To help understand the concepts of Type I error and Type II error, observe the following table: FIGURE 10.2: Type I and Type II errors If we are using sample data to make inferences about a parameter, we run the risk of making a mistake. Obviously, we want to minimize our chance of error; we want a small probability of drawing an incorrect conclusion. The probability of a Type I Error occurring is denoted by \\(\\alpha\\) and is called the significance level of a hypothesis test The probability of a Type II Error is denoted by \\(\\beta\\). Formally, we can define \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) in regards to the table above, but for hypothesis tests instead of a criminal trial. \\(\\alpha\\) corresponds to the probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\) when, in fact, \\(H_0\\) is true. \\(\\beta\\) corresponds to the probability of failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when, in fact, \\(H_0\\) is false. Ideally, we want \\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0\\), meaning that the chance of making an error does not exist. When we have to use incomplete information (sample data), it is not possible to have both \\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0\\). We will always have the possibility of at least one error existing when we use sample data. Usually, what is done is that \\(\\alpha\\) is set before the hypothesis test is conducted and then the evidence is judged against that significance level. Common values for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10. If \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), we are using a testing procedure that, used over and over with different samples, rejects a TRUE null hypothesis five percent of the time. So if we can set \\(\\alpha\\) to be whatever we want, why choose 0.05 instead of 0.01 or even better 0.0000000000000001? Well, a small \\(\\alpha\\) means the test procedure requires the evidence against \\(H_0\\) to be very strong before we can reject \\(H_0\\). This means we will almost never reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\alpha\\) is very small. If we almost never reject \\(H_0\\), the probability of a Type II Error – failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when we should – will increase! Thus, as \\(\\alpha\\) decreases, \\(\\beta\\) increases and as \\(\\alpha\\) increases, \\(\\beta\\) decreases. We, therefore, need to strike a balance in \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) and the common values for \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10 usually lead to a nice balance. Learning check (LC10.2) Reproduce the table above about errors, but for a hypothesis test, instead of the one provided for a criminal trial. 10.4.1 Logic of hypothesis testing Take a random sample (or samples) from a population (or multiple populations) If the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis, do not reject the null hypothesis. If the sample data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis), reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence the alternative hypothesis is true (based on the particular sample collected). 10.5 Statistical significance The idea that sample results are more extreme than we would reasonably expect to see by random chance if the null hypothesis were true is the fundamental idea behind statistical hypothesis tests. If data at least as extreme would be very unlikely if the null hypothesis were true, we say the data are statistically significant. Statistically significant data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, and allow us to generalize our sample results to the claim about the population. Learning check (LC10.3) What is wrong about saying “The defendant is innocent.” based on the US system of criminal trials? (LC10.4) What is the purpose of hypothesis testing? (LC10.5) What are some flaws with hypothesis testing? How could we alleviate them? 10.6 Hypothesis testing with infer The “There is Only One Test” diagram mentioned in Section 10.2 was the inspiration for the infer pipeline that you saw for confidence intervals in Chapter 9. For hypothesis tests, we include one more verb into the pipeline: the hypothesize() verb. Its main argument is null which is either &quot;point&quot; for point hypotheses involving a single sample or &quot;independence&quot; for testing for independence between two variables. We’ll first explore the two variable case by comparing two means. Note the section headings here that refer to the “There is Only One Test” diagram. We will lay out the specifics for each problem using this framework and the infer pipeline together. 10.7 Example: Comparing two means 10.7.1 Randomization/permutation We will now focus on building hypotheses looking at the difference between two population means in an example. We will denote population means using the Greek symbol \\(\\mu\\) (pronounced “mu”). Thus, we will be looking to see if one group “out-performs” another group. This is quite possibly the most common type of statistical inference and serves as a basis for many other types of analyses when comparing the relationship between two variables. Our null hypothesis will be of the form \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\), which can also be written as \\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\). Our alternative hypothesis will be of the form \\(H_0: \\mu_1 \\star \\mu_2\\) (or \\(H_a: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\, \\star \\, 0\\)) where \\(\\star\\) = \\(&lt;\\), \\(\\ne\\), or \\(&gt;\\) depending on the context of the problem. You needn’t focus on these new symbols too much at this point. It will just be a shortcut way for us to describe our hypotheses. As we saw in Chapter 9, bootstrapping is a valuable tool when conducting inferences based on one or two population variables. We will see that the process of randomization (also known as permutation) will be valuable in conducting tests comparing quantitative values from two groups. 10.7.2 Comparing action and romance movies The movies dataset in the ggplot2movies package contains information on a large number of movies that have been rated by users of IMDB.com (Wickham 2015). We are interested in the question here of whether Action movies are rated higher on IMDB than Romance movies. We will first need to do a little bit of data wrangling using the ideas from Chapter 4 to get the data in the form that we would like: movies_trimmed &lt;- movies %&gt;% select(title, year, rating, Action, Romance) Note that Action and Romance are binary variables here. To remove any overlap of movies (and potential confusion) that are both Action and Romance, we will remove them from our population: movies_trimmed &lt;- movies_trimmed %&gt;% filter(!(Action == 1 &amp; Romance == 1)) We will now create a new variable called genre that specifies whether a movie in our movies_trimmed data frame is an &quot;Action&quot; movie, a &quot;Romance&quot; movie, or &quot;Neither&quot;. We aren’t really interested in the &quot;Neither&quot; category here so we will exclude those rows as well. Lastly, the Action and Romance columns are not needed anymore since they are encoded in the genre column. movies_trimmed &lt;- movies_trimmed %&gt;% mutate(genre = case_when(Action == 1 ~ &quot;Action&quot;, Romance == 1 ~ &quot;Romance&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Neither&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(genre != &quot;Neither&quot;) %&gt;% select(-Action, -Romance) The case_when function is useful for assigning values in a new variable based on the values of another variable. The last step of TRUE ~ &quot;Neither&quot; is used when a particular movie is not set to either Action or Romance. We are left with 8878 movies in our population dataset that focuses on only &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Romance&quot; movies. Learning check (LC10.6) Why are the different genre variables stored as binary variables (1s and 0s) instead of just listing the genre as a column of values like “Action”, “Comedy”, etc.? (LC10.7) What complications could come above with us excluding action romance movies? Should we question the results of our hypothesis test? Explain. Let’s now visualize the distributions of rating across both levels of genre. Think about what type(s) of plot is/are appropriate here before you proceed: ggplot(data = movies_trimmed, aes(x = genre, y = rating)) + geom_boxplot() FIGURE 10.3: Rating vs genre in the population We can see that the middle 50% of ratings for &quot;Action&quot; movies is more spread out than that of &quot;Romance&quot; movies in the population. &quot;Romance&quot; has outliers at both the top and bottoms of the scale though. We are initially interested in comparing the mean rating across these two groups so a faceted histogram may also be useful: ggplot(data = movies_trimmed, mapping = aes(x = rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_grid(genre ~ .) FIGURE 10.4: Faceted histogram of genre vs rating Important note: Remember that we hardly ever have access to the population values as we do here. This example and the nycflights13 dataset were used to create a common flow from chapter to chapter. In nearly all circumstances, we’ll be needing to use only a sample of the population to try to infer conclusions about the unknown population parameter values. These examples do show a nice relationship between statistics (where data is usually small and more focused on experimental settings) and data science (where data is frequently large and collected without experimental conditions). 10.7.3 Sampling \\(\\rightarrow\\) randomization We can use hypothesis testing to investigate ways to determine, for example, whether a treatment has an effect over a control and other ways to statistically analyze if one group performs better than, worse than, or different than another. We are interested here in seeing how we can use a random sample of action movies and a random sample of romance movies from movies to determine if a statistical difference exists in the mean ratings of each group. Learning check (LC10.8) Define the relevant parameters here in terms of the populations of movies. 10.7.4 Data Let’s select a random sample of 34 action movies and a random sample of 34 romance movies. (The number 34 was chosen somewhat arbitrarily here.) set.seed(2017) movies_genre_sample &lt;- movies_trimmed %&gt;% group_by(genre) %&gt;% sample_n(34) %&gt;% ungroup() Note the addition of the ungroup() function here. This will be useful shortly in allowing us to permute the values of rating across genre. Our analysis does not work without this ungroup() function since the data stays grouped by the levels of genre without it. We can now observe the distributions of our two sample ratings for both groups. Remember that these plots should be rough approximations of our population distributions of movie ratings for &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Romance&quot; in our population of all movies in the movies data frame. ggplot(data = movies_genre_sample, aes(x = genre, y = rating)) + geom_boxplot() FIGURE 10.5: Genre vs rating for our sample ggplot(data = movies_genre_sample, mapping = aes(x = rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_grid(genre ~ .) FIGURE 10.6: Genre vs rating for our sample as faceted histogram Learning check (LC10.9) What single value could we change to improve the approximation using the sample distribution on the population distribution? Do we have reason to believe, based on the sample distributions of rating over the two groups of genre, that there is a significant difference between the mean rating for action movies compared to romance movies? It’s hard to say just based on the plots. The boxplot does show that the median sample rating is higher for romance movies, but the histogram isn’t as clear. The two groups have somewhat differently shaped distributions but they are both over similar values of rating. It’s often useful to calculate the mean and standard deviation as well, conditioned on the two levels. summary_ratings &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% group_by(genre) %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(rating), std_dev = sd(rating), n = n()) summary_ratings # A tibble: 2 x 4 genre mean std_dev n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 Action 5.11 1.49 34 2 Romance 6.06 1.15 34 Learning check (LC10.10) Why did we not specify na.rm = TRUE here as we did in Chapter 4? We see that the sample mean rating for romance movies, \\(\\bar{x}_{r}\\), is greater than the similar measure for action movies, \\(\\bar{x}_a\\). But is it statistically significantly greater (thus, leading us to conclude that the means are statistically different)? The standard deviation can provide some insight here but with these standard deviations being so similar it’s still hard to say for sure. Learning check (LC10.11) Why might the standard deviation provide some insight about the means being statistically different or not? 10.7.5 Model of \\(H_0\\) The hypotheses we specified can also be written in another form to better give us an idea of what we will be simulating to create our null distribution. \\(H_0: \\mu_r - \\mu_a = 0\\) \\(H_a: \\mu_r - \\mu_a \\ne 0\\) 10.7.6 Test statistic \\(\\delta\\) We are, therefore, interested in seeing whether the difference in the sample means, \\(\\bar{x}_r - \\bar{x}_a\\), is statistically different than 0. We can now come back to our infer pipeline for computing our observed statistic. Note the order argument that shows the mean value for &quot;Action&quot; being subtracted from the mean value of &quot;Romance&quot;. 10.7.7 Observed effect \\(\\delta^*\\) obs_diff &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) obs_diff # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.95 Our goal next is to figure out a random process with which to simulate the null hypothesis being true. Recall that \\(H_0: \\mu_r - \\mu_a = 0\\) corresponds to us assuming that the population means are the same. We would like to assume this is true and perform a random process to generate() data in the model of the null hypothesis. 10.7.8 Simulated data Tactile simulation Here, with us assuming the two population means are equal (\\(H_0: \\mu_r - \\mu_a = 0\\)), we can look at this from a tactile point of view by using index cards. There are \\(n_r = 34\\) data elements corresponding to romance movies and \\(n_a = 34\\) for action movies. We can write the 34 ratings from our sample for romance movies on one set of 34 index cards and the 34 ratings for action movies on another set of 34 index cards. (Note that the sample sizes need not be the same.) The next step is to put the two stacks of index cards together, creating a new set of 68 cards. If we assume that the two population means are equal, we are saying that there is no association between ratings and genre (romance vs action). We can use the index cards to create two new stacks for romance and action movies. Note that the new “romance movie stack” will likely have some of the original action movies in it and likewise for the “action movie stack” including some romance movies from our original set. Since we are assuming that each card is equally likely to have appeared in either one of the stacks this makes sense. First, we must shuffle all the cards thoroughly. After doing so, in this case with equal values of sample sizes, we split the deck in half. We then calculate the new sample mean rating of the romance deck, and also the new sample mean rating of the action deck. This creates one simulation of the samples that were collected originally. We next want to calculate a statistic from these two samples. Instead of actually doing the calculation using index cards, we can use R as we have before to simulate this process. Let’s do this just once and compare the results to what we see in movies_genre_sample. movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.515 Learning check (LC10.12) How would the tactile shuffling of index cards change if we had different samples of say 20 action movies and 60 romance movies? Describe each step that would change. (LC10.13) Why are we taking the difference in the means of the cards in the new shuffled decks? 10.7.9 Distribution of \\(\\delta\\) under \\(H_0\\) The generate() step completes a permutation sending values of ratings to potentially different values of genre from which they originally came. It simulates a shuffling of the ratings between the two levels of genre just as we could have done with index cards. We can now proceed in a similar way to what we have done previously with bootstrapping by repeating this process many times to create simulated samples, assuming the null hypothesis is true. generated_samples &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) A null distribution of simulated differences in sample means is created with the specification of stat = &quot;diff in means&quot; for the calculate() step. The null distribution is similar to the bootstrap distribution we saw in Chapter 9, but remember that it consists of statistics generated assuming the null hypothesis is true. We can now plot the distribution of these simulated differences in means: null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% visualize() FIGURE 10.7: Simulated differences in means histogram 10.7.10 The p-value Remember that we are interested in seeing where our observed sample mean difference of 0.95 falls on this null/randomization distribution. We are interested in simply a difference here so “more extreme” corresponds to values in both tails on the distribution. Let’s shade our null distribution to show a visual representation of our \\(p\\)-value: null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;both&quot;) FIGURE 10.8: Shaded histogram to show p-value Remember that the observed difference in means was 0.95. We have shaded red all values at or above that value and also shaded red those values at or below its negative value (since this is a two-tailed test). By giving obs_stat = obs_diff a vertical darker line is also shown at 0.95. To better estimate how large the \\(p\\)-value will be, we also increase the number of bins to 100 here from 20: null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% visualize(bins = 100, obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;both&quot;) FIGURE 10.9: Histogram with vertical lines corresponding to observed statistic At this point, it is important to take a guess as to what the \\(p\\)-value may be. We can see that there are only a few permuted differences as extreme or more extreme than our observed effect (in both directions). Maybe we guess that this \\(p\\)-value is somewhere around 2%, or maybe 3%, but certainly not 30% or more. Lastly, we calculate the \\(p\\)-value directly using infer: pvalue &lt;- null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 x 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.006 We have around 0.6% of values as extreme or more extreme than our observed statistic in both directions. Assuming we are using a 5% significance level for \\(\\alpha\\), we have evidence supporting the conclusion that the mean rating for romance movies is different from that of action movies. The next important idea is to better understand just how much higher of a mean rating can we expect the romance movies to have compared to that of action movies. 10.7.11 Corresponding confidence interval One of the great things about the infer pipeline is that going between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals is incredibly simple. To create a null distribution, we ran null_distribution_two_means &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) To get the corresponding bootstrap distribution with which we can compute a confidence interval, we can just remove or comment out the hypothesize() step since we are no longer assuming the null hypothesis is true when we bootstrap: percentile_ci_two_means &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% # hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) %&gt;% get_ci() Setting `type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;` in `generate()`. percentile_ci_two_means # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.333 1.59 Thus, we can expect the true mean of Romance movies on IMDB to have a rating 0.333 to 1.593 points higher than that of Action movies. Remember that this is based on bootstrapping using movies_genre_sample as our original sample and the confidence interval process being 95% reliable. Learning check (LC10.14) Conduct the same analysis comparing action movies versus romantic movies using the median rating instead of the mean rating? What was different and what was the same? (LC10.15) What conclusions can you make from viewing the faceted histogram looking at rating versus genre that you couldn’t see when looking at the boxplot? (LC10.16) Describe in a paragraph how we used Allen Downey’s diagram to conclude if a statistical difference existed between mean movie ratings for action and romance movies. (LC10.17) Why are we relatively confident that the distributions of the sample ratings will be good approximations of the population distributions of ratings for the two genres? (LC10.18) Using the definition of “\\(p\\)-value”, write in words what the \\(p\\)-value represents for the hypothesis test above comparing the mean rating of romance to action movies. (LC10.19) What is the value of the \\(p\\)-value for the hypothesis test comparing the mean rating of romance to action movies? (LC10.20) Do the results of the hypothesis test match up with the original plots we made looking at the population of movies? Why or why not? 10.7.12 Summary To review, these are the steps one would take whenever you’d like to do a hypothesis test comparing values from the distributions of two groups: Simulate many samples using a random process that matches the way the original data were collected and that assumes the null hypothesis is true. Collect the values of a sample statistic for each sample created using this random process to build a null distribution. Assess the significance of the original sample by determining where its sample statistic lies in the null distribution. If the proportion of values as extreme or more extreme than the observed statistic in the randomization distribution is smaller than the pre-determined significance level \\(\\alpha\\), we reject \\(H_0\\). Otherwise, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). (If no significance level is given, one can assume \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).) 10.8 Building theory-based methods using computation As a point of reference, we will now discuss the traditional theory-based way to conduct the hypothesis test for determining if there is a statistically significant difference in the sample mean rating of Action movies versus Romance movies. This method and ones like it work very well when the assumptions are met in order to run the test. They are based on probability models and distributions such as the normal and \\(t\\)-distributions. These traditional methods have been used for many decades back to the time when researchers didn’t have access to computers that could run 5000 simulations in a few seconds. They had to base their methods on probability theory instead. Many fields and researchers continue to use these methods and that is the biggest reason for their inclusion here. It’s important to remember that a \\(t\\)-test or a \\(z\\)-test is really just an approximation of what you have seen in this chapter already using simulation and randomization. The focus here is on understanding how the shape of the \\(t\\)-curve comes about without digging big into the mathematical underpinnings. 10.8.1 Example: \\(t\\)-test for two independent samples What is commonly done in statistics is the process of standardization. What this entails is calculating the mean and standard deviation of a variable. Then you subtract the mean from each value of your variable and divide by the standard deviation. The most common standardization is known as the \\(z\\)-score. The formula for a \\(z\\)-score is \\[Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma},\\] where \\(x\\) represent the value of a variable, \\(\\mu\\) represents the mean of the variable, and \\(\\sigma\\) represents the standard deviation of the variable. Thus, if your variable has 10 elements, each one has a corresponding \\(z\\)-score that gives how many standard deviations away that value is from its mean. \\(z\\)-scores are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. They have the common, bell-shaped pattern seen below. Recall, that we hardly ever know the mean and standard deviation of the population of interest. This is almost always the case when considering the means of two independent groups. To help account for us not knowing the population parameter values, we can use the sample statistics instead, but this comes with a bit of a price in terms of complexity. Another form of standardization occurs when we need to use the sample standard deviations as estimates for the unknown population standard deviations. This standardization is often called the \\(t\\)-score. For the two independent samples case like what we have for comparing action movies to romance movies, the formula is \\[T =\\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_1}^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{{s_2}^2}{n_2}} }\\] There is a lot to try to unpack here. \\(\\bar{x}_1\\) is the sample mean response of the first group \\(\\bar{x}_2\\) is the sample mean response of the second group \\(\\mu_1\\) is the population mean response of the first group \\(\\mu_2\\) is the population mean response of the second group \\(s_1\\) is the sample standard deviation of the response of the first group \\(s_2\\) is the sample standard deviation of the response of the second group \\(n_1\\) is the sample size of the first group \\(n_2\\) is the sample size of the second group Assuming that the null hypothesis is true (\\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\)), \\(T\\) is said to be distributed following a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the smaller value of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\). The “degrees of freedom” can be thought of measuring how different the \\(t\\) distribution will be as compared to a normal distribution. Small sample sizes lead to small degrees of freedom and, thus, \\(t\\) distributions that have more values in the tails of their distributions. Large sample sizes lead to large degrees of freedom and, thus, \\(t\\) distributions that closely align with the standard normal, bell-shaped curve. So, assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, our formula simplifies a bit: \\[T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_1}^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{{s_2}^2}{n_2}} }.\\] We have already built an approximation for what we think the distribution of \\(\\delta = \\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\) looks like using randomization above. Recall this distribution: ggplot(data = null_distribution_two_means, aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) FIGURE 10.10: Simulated differences in means histogram The infer package also includes some built-in theory-based statistics as well, so instead of going through the process of trying to transform the difference into a standardized form, we can just provide a different value for stat in calculate(). Recall the generated_samples data frame created via: generated_samples &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) We can now created a null distribution of \\(t\\) statistics: null_distribution_t &lt;- generated_samples %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) null_distribution_t %&gt;% visualize() We see that the shape of this stat = &quot;t&quot; distribution is the same as that of stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;. The scale has changed though with the \\(t\\) values having less spread than the difference in means. A traditional \\(t\\)-test doesn’t look at this simulated distribution, but instead it looks at the \\(t\\)-curve with degrees of freedom equal to 62.029. We can overlay this distribution over the top of our permuted \\(t\\) statistics using the method = &quot;both&quot; setting in visualize(). null_distribution_t %&gt;% visualize(method = &quot;both&quot;) We can see that the curve does a good job of approximating the randomization distribution here. (More on when to expect for this to be the case when we discuss conditions for the \\(t\\)-test in a bit.) To calculate the \\(p\\)-value in this case, we need to figure out how much of the total area under the \\(t\\)-curve is at our observed \\(T\\)-statistic or more, plus also adding the area under the curve at the negative value of the observed \\(T\\)-statistic or below. (Remember this is a two-tailed test so we are looking for a difference–values in the tails of either direction.) Just as we converted all of the simulated values to \\(T\\)-statistics, we must also do so for our observed effect \\(\\delta^*\\): obs_t &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) So graphically we are interested in finding the percentage of values that are at or above 2.945 or at or below -2.945. null_distribution_t %&gt;% visualize(method = &quot;both&quot;, obs_stat = obs_t, direction = &quot;both&quot;) As we might have expected with this just being a standardization of the difference in means statistic that produced a small \\(p\\)-value, we also have a very small one here. 10.8.2 Conditions for t-test The infer package does not automatically check conditions for the theoretical methods to work and this warning was given when we used method = &quot;both&quot;. In order for the results of the \\(t\\)-test to be valid, three conditions must be met: Independent observations in both samples Nearly normal populations OR large sample sizes (\\(n \\ge 30\\)) Independently selected samples Condition 1: This is met since we sampled at random using R from our population. Condition 2: Recall from Figure 10.4, that we know how the populations are distributed. Both of them are close to normally distributed. If we are a little concerned about this assumption, we also do have samples of size larger than 30 (\\(n_1 = n_2 = 34\\)). Condition 3: This is met since there is no natural pairing of a movie in the Action group to a movie in the Romance group. Since all three conditions are met, we can be reasonably certain that the theory-based test will match the results of the randomization-based test using shuffling. Remember that theory-based tests can produce some incorrect results in these assumptions are not carefully checked. The only assumption for randomization and computational-based methods is that the sample is selected at random. They are our preference and we strongly believe they should be yours as well, but it’s important to also see how the theory-based tests can be done and used as an approximation for the computational techniques until at least more researchers are using these techniques that utilize the power of computers. 10.9 Conclusion We conclude by showing the infer pipeline diagram. In Chapter 11, we’ll come back to regression and see how the ideas covered in Chapter 9 and this chapter can help in understanding the significance of predictors in modeling. 10.9.1 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here.

Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(infer) library(gapminder) library(ISLR) 11.1 Simulation-based Inference for Regression We can also use the concept of permuting to determine the standard error of our null distribution and conduct a hypothesis test for a population slope. Let’s go back to our example on teacher evaluations Chapters 6 and 7. We’ll begin in the basic regression setting to test to see if we have evidence that a statistically significant positive relationship exists between teaching and beauty scores for the University of Texas professors. As we did in Chapter 6, teaching score will act as our outcome variable and bty_avg will be our explanatory variable. We will set up this hypothesis testing process as we have each before via the “There is Only One Test” diagram in Figure 10.1 using the infer package. 11.1.1 Data Our data is stored in evals and we are focused on the measurements of the score and bty_avg variables there. Note that we don’t choose a subset of variables here since we will specify() the variables of interest using infer. evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) Response: score (numeric) Explanatory: bty_avg (numeric) # A tibble: 463 x 2 score bty_avg &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 4.7 5 2 4.1 5 3 3.9 5 4 4.8 5 5 4.6 3 6 4.3 3 7 2.8 3 8 4.1 3.33 9 3.4 3.33 10 4.5 3.17 # … with 453 more rows 11.1.2 Test statistic \\(\\delta\\) Our test statistic here is the sample slope coefficient that we denote with \\(b_1\\). 11.1.3 Observed effect \\(\\delta^*\\) We can use the specify() %&gt;% calculate() shortcut here to determine the slope value seen in our observed data: slope_obs &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) The calculated slope value from our observed sample is \\(b_1 = 0.067\\). 11.1.4 Model of \\(H_0\\) We are looking to see if a positive relationship exists so \\(H_A: \\beta_1 &gt; 0\\). Our null hypothesis is always in terms of equality so we have \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\). In other words, when we assume the null hypothesis is true, we are assuming there is NOT a linear relationship between teaching and beauty scores for University of Texas professors. 11.1.5 Simulated data Now to simulate the null hypothesis being true and recreating how our sample was created, we need to think about what it means for \\(\\beta_1\\) to be zero. If \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), we said above that there is no relationship between the teaching and beauty scores. If there is no relationship, then any one of the teaching score values could have just as likely occurred with any of the other beauty score values instead of the one that it actually did fall with. We, therefore, have another example of permuting in our simulating of data under the null hypothesis. Tactile simulation We could use a deck of 926 note cards to create a tactile simulation of this permuting process. We would write the 463 different values of beauty scores on each of the 463 cards, one per card. We would then do the same thing for the 463 teaching scores putting them on one per card. Next, we would lay out each of the 463 beauty score cards and we would shuffle the teaching score deck. Then, after shuffling the deck well, we would disperse the cards one per each one of the beauty score cards. We would then enter these new values in for teaching score and compute a sample slope based on this permuting. We could repeat this process many times, keeping track of our sample slope after each shuffle. 11.1.6 Distribution of \\(\\delta\\) under \\(H_0\\) We can build our null distribution in much the same way we did in Chapter 10 using the generate() and calculate() functions. Note also the addition of the hypothesize() function, which lets generate() know to perform the permuting instead of bootstrapping. null_slope_distn &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) null_slope_distn %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = slope_obs, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) In viewing the distribution above with shading to the right of our observed slope value of 0.067, we can see that we expect the p-value to be quite small. Let’s calculate it next using a similar syntax to what was done with visualize(). 11.1.7 The p-value null_slope_distn %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = slope_obs, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) # A tibble: 1 x 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 Since 0.067 falls far to the right of this plot beyond where any of the histogram bins have data, we can say that we have a \\(p\\)-value of 0. We, thus, have evidence to reject the null hypothesis in support of there being a positive association between the beauty score and teaching score of University of Texas faculty members. Learning check (LC11.1) Repeat the inference above but this time for the correlation coefficient instead of the slope. Note the implementation of stat = &quot;correlation&quot; in the calculate() function of the infer package. 11.2 Bootstrapping for the regression slope With the p-value calculated as 0 in the hypothesis test above, we can next determine just how strong of a positive slope value we might expect between the variables of teaching score and beauty score (bty_avg) for University of Texas faculty. Recall the infer pipeline above to compute the null distribution. Recall that this assumes the null hypothesis is true that there is no relationship between teaching score and beauty score using the hypothesize() function. null_slope_distn &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) To further reinforce the process being done in the pipeline, we’ve added the type argument to generate(). This is automatically added based on the entries for specify() and hypothesize() but it provides a useful way to check to make sure generate() is created the samples in the desired way. In this case, we permuted the values of one variable across the values of the other 10,000 times and calculated a &quot;slope&quot; coefficient for each of these 10,000 generated samples. If instead we’d like to get a range of plausible values for the true slope value, we can use the process of bootstrapping: bootstrap_slope_distn &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) bootstrap_slope_distn %&gt;% visualize() Next we can use the get_ci() function to determine the confidence interval. Let’s do this in two different ways obtaining 99% confidence intervals. Remember that these denote a range of plausible values for an unknown true population slope parameter regressing teaching score on beauty score. percentile_slope_ci &lt;- bootstrap_slope_distn %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.99, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) percentile_slope_ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 `0.5%` `99.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0229 0.110 se_slope_ci &lt;- bootstrap_slope_distn %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.99, type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = slope_obs) se_slope_ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 lower upper &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0220 0.111 With the bootstrap distribution being close to symmetric, it makes sense that the two resulting confidence intervals are similar. 11.3 Inference for multiple regression 11.3.1 Refresher: Professor evaluations data Let’s revisit the professor evaluations data that we analyzed using multiple regression with one numerical and one categorical predictor. In particular \\(y\\): outcome variable of instructor evaluation score predictor variables \\(x_1\\): numerical explanatory/predictor variable of age \\(x_2\\): categorical explanatory/predictor variable of gender library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) evals_multiple &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, ethnicity, gender, language, age, bty_avg, rank) First, recall that we had two competing potential models to explain professors’ teaching scores: Model 1: No interaction term. i.e. both male and female profs have the same slope describing the associated effect of age on teaching score Model 2: Includes an interaction term. i.e. we allow for male and female profs to have different slopes describing the associated effect of age on teaching score 11.3.2 Refresher: Visualizations Recall the plots we made for both these models: FIGURE 11.1: Model 1: no interaction effect included FIGURE 11.2: Model 2: interaction effect included 11.3.3 Refresher: Regression tables Last, let’s recall the regressions we fit. First, the regression with no interaction effect: note the use of + in the formula in Table 11.1. score_model_2 &lt;- lm(score ~ age + gender, data = evals_multiple) get_regression_table(score_model_2) TABLE 11.1: Model 1: Regression table with no interaction effect included term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.484 0.125 35.79 0.000 4.238 4.730 age -0.009 0.003 -3.28 0.001 -0.014 -0.003 gendermale 0.191 0.052 3.63 0.000 0.087 0.294 Second, the regression with an interaction effect: note the use of * in the formula. score_model_3 &lt;- lm(score ~ age * gender, data = evals_multiple) get_regression_table(score_model_3) TABLE 11.2: Model 2: Regression table with interaction effect included term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.883 0.205 23.80 0.000 4.480 5.286 age -0.018 0.004 -3.92 0.000 -0.026 -0.009 gendermale -0.446 0.265 -1.68 0.094 -0.968 0.076 age:gendermale 0.014 0.006 2.45 0.015 0.003 0.024 11.3.4 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. 11.4 Residual analysis 11.4.1 Residual analysis Recall the residuals can be thought of as the error or the “lack-of-fit” between the observed value \\(y\\) and the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) on the blue regression line in Figure 6.6. Ideally when we fit a regression model, we’d like there to be no systematic pattern to these residuals. We’ll be more specific as to what we mean by no systematic pattern when we see Figure 11.4 below, but let’s keep this notion imprecise for now. Investigating any such patterns is known as residual analysis and is the theme of this section. We’ll perform our residual analysis in two ways: Creating a scatterplot with the residuals on the \\(y\\)-axis and the original explanatory variable \\(x\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis. Creating a histogram of the residuals, thereby showing the distribution of the residuals. First, recall in Figure 6.8 above we created a scatterplot where on the vertical axis we had the teaching score \\(y\\), on the horizontal axis we had the beauty score \\(x\\), and the blue arrow represented the residual for one particular instructor. Instead, in Figure 11.3 below, let’s create a scatterplot where On the vertical axis we have the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) instead On the horizontal axis we have the beauty score \\(x\\) as before: # Get data evals_ch6 &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, bty_avg, age) # Fit regression model: score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch6) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(score_model) # A tibble: 2 x 7 term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 intercept 3.88 0.076 51.0 0 3.73 4.03 2 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 # Get regression points regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(score_model) ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = bty_avg, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 1) FIGURE 11.3: Plot of residuals over beauty score You can think of Figure 11.3 as Figure 6.8 but with the blue line flattened out to \\(y=0\\). Does it seem like there is no systematic pattern to the residuals? This question is rather qualitative and subjective in nature, thus different people may respond with different answers to the above question. However, it can be argued that there isn’t a drastic pattern in the residuals. Let’s now get a little more precise in our definition of no systematic pattern in the residuals. Ideally, the residuals should behave randomly. In addition, the residuals should be on average 0. In other words, sometimes the regression model will make a positive error in that \\(y - \\widehat{y} &gt; 0\\), sometimes the regression model will make a negative error in that \\(y - \\widehat{y} &lt; 0\\), but on average the error is 0. Further, the value and spread of the residuals should not depend on the value of \\(x\\). In Figure 11.4 below, we display some hypothetical examples where there are drastic patterns to the residuals. In Example 1, the value of the residual seems to depend on \\(x\\): the residuals tend to be positive for small and large values of \\(x\\) in this range, whereas values of \\(x\\) more in the middle tend to have negative residuals. In Example 2, while the residuals seem to be on average 0 for each value of \\(x\\), the spread of the residuals varies for different values of \\(x\\); this situation is known as heteroskedasticity. FIGURE 11.4: Examples of less than ideal residual patterns The second way to perform a residual analysis is to look at the histogram of the residuals: ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) FIGURE 11.5: Histogram of residuals This histogram seems to indicate that we have more positive residuals than negative. Since the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) is positive when \\(y &gt; \\widehat{y}\\), it seems our fitted teaching score from the regression model tends to underestimate the true teaching score. This histogram has a slight left-skew in that there is a long tail on the left. Another way to say this is this data exhibits a negative skew. Is this a problem? Again, there is a certain amount of subjectivity in the response. In the authors’ opinion, while there is a slight skew/pattern to the residuals, it isn’t a large concern. On the other hand, others might disagree with our assessment. Here are examples of an ideal and less than ideal pattern to the residuals when viewed in a histogram: FIGURE 11.6: Examples of ideal and less than ideal residual patterns In fact, we’ll see later on that we would like the residuals to be normally distributed with mean 0. In other words, be bell-shaped and centered at 0! While this requirement and residual analysis in general may seem to some of you as not being overly critical at this point, we’ll see later after when we cover inference for regression in Chapter 11 that for the last five columns of the regression table from earlier (std error, statistic, p_value,lower_ci, and upper_ci) to have valid interpretations, the above three conditions should roughly hold. Learning check (LC11.2) Continuing with our regression using age as the explanatory variable and teaching score as the outcome variable, use the get_regression_points() function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 463 instructors. Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Ideally, there should be little to no pattern. 11.4.2 Residual analysis # Get data: gapminder2007 &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% filter(year == 2007) %&gt;% select(country, continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap) # Fit regression model: lifeExp_model &lt;- lm(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder2007) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(lifeExp_model) # A tibble: 5 x 7 term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 intercept 54.8 1.02 53.4 0 52.8 56.8 2 continentAmericas 18.8 1.8 10.4 0 15.2 22.4 3 continentAsia 15.9 1.65 9.68 0 12.7 19.2 4 continentEurope 22.8 1.70 13.5 0 19.5 26.2 5 continentOceania 25.9 5.33 4.86 0 15.4 36.4 # Get regression points regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(lifeExp_model) Recall our discussion on residuals from Section 11.4.1 where our goal was to investigate whether or not there was a systematic pattern to the residuals. Ideally since residuals can be thought of as error, there should be no such pattern. While there are many ways to do such residual analysis, we focused on two approaches based on visualizations. A plot with residuals on the vertical axis and the predictor (in this case continent) on the horizontal axis A histogram of all residuals First, let’s plot the residuals versus continent in Figure 11.7, but also let’s plot all 142 points with a little horizontal random jitter by setting the width = 0.1 parameter in geom_jitter(): ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = continent, y = residual)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1) + labs(x = &quot;Continent&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;) FIGURE 11.7: Plot of residuals over continent We observe There seems to be a rough balance of both positive and negative residuals for all 5 continents. However, there is one clear outlier in Asia, which has a residual with the largest deviation away from 0. Let’s investigate the 5 countries in Asia with the shortest life expectancy: gapminder2007 %&gt;% filter(continent == &quot;Asia&quot;) %&gt;% arrange(lifeExp) TABLE 11.3: Countries in Asia with shortest life expectancy country continent lifeExp gdpPercap Afghanistan Asia 43.8 975 Iraq Asia 59.5 4471 Cambodia Asia 59.7 1714 Myanmar Asia 62.1 944 Yemen, Rep. Asia 62.7 2281 This was the earlier identified residual for Afghanistan of -26.9. Unfortunately given recent geopolitical turmoil, individuals who live in Afghanistan and, in particular in 2007, have a drastically lower life expectancy. Second, let’s look at a histogram of all 142 values of residuals in Figure 11.8. In this case, the residuals form a rather nice bell-shape, although there are a couple of very low and very high values at the tails. As we said previously, searching for patterns in residuals can be somewhat subjective, but ideally we hope there are no “drastic” patterns. ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) FIGURE 11.8: Histogram of residuals Learning check (LC11.3) Continuing with our regression using gdpPercap as the outcome variable and continent as the explanatory variable, use the get_regression_points() function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 142 countries in 2007 and perform a residual analysis to look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Is there a pattern? Please keep in mind that these types of questions are somewhat subjective and different people will most likely have different answers. The focus should be on being able to justify the conclusions made. 11.4.3 Residual analysis Recall in Section 11.4.1, our first residual analysis plot investigated the presence of any systematic pattern in the residuals when we had a single numerical predictor: bty_age. For the Credit card dataset, since we have two numerical predictors, Limit and Income, we must perform this twice: # Get data: Credit &lt;- Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Limit, Income, Rating, Age) # Fit regression model: Balance_model &lt;- lm(Balance ~ Limit + Income, data = Credit) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(Balance_model) # A tibble: 3 x 7 term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 intercept -385. 19.5 -19.8 0 -423. -347. 2 Limit 0.264 0.006 45.0 0 0.253 0.276 3 Income -7.66 0.385 -19.9 0 -8.42 -6.91 # Get regression points regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(Balance_model) ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = Limit, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Credit limit (in $)&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;, title = &quot;Residuals vs credit limit&quot;) ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = Income, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Income (in $1000)&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;, title = &quot;Residuals vs income&quot;) FIGURE 11.9: Residuals vs credit limit and income In this case, there does appear to be a systematic pattern to the residuals. As the scatter of the residuals around the line \\(y=0\\) is definitely not consistent. This behavior of the residuals is further evidenced by the histogram of residuals in Figure 11.10. We observe that the residuals have a slight right-skew (recall we say that data is right-skewed, or positively-skewed, if there is a tail to the right). Ideally, these residuals should be bell-shaped around a residual value of 0. ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. FIGURE 11.10: Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income Another way to interpret this histogram is that since the residual is computed as \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = balance - balance_hat, we have some values where the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) is very much lower than the observed value \\(y\\). In other words, we are underestimating certain credit card holders’ balances by a very large amount. Learning check (LC11.4) Continuing with our regression using Rating and Age as the explanatory variables and credit card Balance as the outcome variable, use the get_regression_points() function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 400 credit card holders. Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. 11.4.4 Residual analysis # Get data: evals_ch7 &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, age, gender) # Fit regression model: score_model_2 &lt;- lm(score ~ age + gender, data = evals_ch7) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(score_model_2) # A tibble: 3 x 7 term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 intercept 4.48 0.125 35.8 0 4.24 4.73 2 age -0.009 0.003 -3.28 0.001 -0.014 -0.003 3 gendermale 0.191 0.052 3.63 0 0.087 0.294 # Get regression points regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(score_model_2) As always, let’s perform a residual analysis first with a histogram, which we can facet by gender: ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) + facet_wrap(~gender) FIGURE 11.11: Interaction model histogram of residuals Second, the residuals as compared to the predictor variables: \\(x_1\\): numerical explanatory/predictor variable of age \\(x_2\\): categorical explanatory/predictor variable of gender ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = age, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;age&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 1) + facet_wrap(~ gender) FIGURE 11.12: Interaction model residuals vs predictor "],

Don’t expect major changes in content, but rather only minor changes in presentation. Our remodeling will be complete and available online at ModernDive.com by early Summer 2019! Recall in Section 1.1 “Introduction for students” and at the end of chapters throughout this book, we displayed the “ModernDive flowchart” mapping your journey through this book. FIGURE 12.1: ModernDive Flowchart Let’s get a refresher of what you’ve covered so far. You first got started with with data in Chapter 2, where you learned about the difference between R and RStudio, started coding in R, started understanding what R packages are, and explored your first dataset: all domestic departure flights from a New York City airport in 2013. Then: Data science: You assembled your data science toolbox using tidyverse packages. In particular: Ch.3: Visualizing data via the ggplot2 package. Ch.5: Understanding the concept of “tidy” data as a standardized data input format for all packages in the tidyverse Ch.4: Wrangling data via the dplyr package. Data modeling: Using these data science tools and helper functions from the moderndive package, you started performing data modeling. In particular: Ch.6: Constructing basic regression models. Ch.7: Constructing multiple regression models. Statistical inference: Once again using your newly acquired data science tools, we unpacked statistical inference using the infer package. In particular: Ch.8: Understanding the role that sampling variability plays in statistical inference using both tactile and virtual simulations of sampling from a “bowl” with an unknown proportion of red balls. Ch.9: Building confidence intervals. Ch.10: Conducting hypothesis tests. Data modeling revisited: Armed with your new understanding of statistical inference, you revisited and reviewed the models you constructed in Ch.6 &amp; Ch.7. In particular: Ch.11: Interpreting both the statistical and practice significance of the results of the models. All this was our approach of guiding you through your first experiences of “thinking with data”, an expression originally coined by Diane Lambert of Google. How the philosophy underlying this expression guided our mapping of the flowchart above was well put in the introduction to the “Practical Data Science for Stats” collection of preprints focusing on the practical side of data science workflows and statistical analysis, curated by Jennifer Bryan and Hadley Wickham: There are many aspects of day-to-day analytical work that are almost absent from the conventional statistics literature and curriculum. And yet these activities account for a considerable share of the time and effort of data analysts and applied statisticians. The goal of this collection is to increase the visibility and adoption of modern data analytical workflows. We aim to facilitate the transfer of tools and frameworks between industry and academia, between software engineering and statistics and computer science, and across different domains. In other words, in order to be equipped to “think with data” in the 21st century, future analysts need preparation going through the entirety of the “Data/Science Pipeline” we also saw earlier and not just parts of it. FIGURE 12.2: Data/Science Pipeline In Section 12.1, we’ll take you through full-pass of the “Data/Science Pipeline” where we’ll analyze the sale price of houses in Seattle, WA, USA. In Section 12.2, we’ll present you with examples of effective data storytelling, in particular the articles from the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com, many of whose source datasets are accessible from the fivethirtyeight R package. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(fivethirtyeight) 12.1 Case study: Seattle house prices Kaggle.com is a machine learning and predictive modeling competition website that hosts datasets uploaded by companies, governmental organizations, and other individuals. One of their datasets is the House Sales in King County, USA consisting of homes sold in between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County, Washington State, USA, which includes the greater Seattle metropolitan area. This CC0: Public Domain licensed dataset is included in the moderndive package in the house_prices data frame, which we’ll refer to as the “Seattle house prices” dataset. The dataset consists 21,613 houses and 21 variables describing these houses; for a full list of these variables see the help file by running ?house_prices in the console. In this case study, we’ll create a model using multiple regression where: The outcome variable \\(y\\) is the sale price of houses The two explanatory/predictor variables we’ll use are : \\(x_1\\): house size sqft_living, as measured by square feet of living space, where 1 square foot is about 0.09 square meters. \\(x_2\\): house condition, a categorical variable with 5 levels where 1 indicates “poor” and 5 indicates “excellent.” Let’s load all the packages needed for this case study (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) 12.1.1 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) A crucial first step before any formal modeling is an exploratory data analysis, commonly abbreviated at EDA. Exploratory data analysis can give you a sense of your data, help identify issues with your data, bring to light any outliers, and help inform model construction. There are three basic approaches to EDA: Most fundamentally, just looking at the raw data. For example using RStudio’s View() spreadsheet viewer or the glimpse() function from the dplyr package Creating visualizations like the ones using ggplot2 from Chapter 3 Computing summary statistics using the dplyr data wrangling tools from Chapter 4 First, let’s look the raw data using View() and the glimpse() function. Explore the dataset. Which variables are numerical and which are categorical? For the categorical variables, what are their levels? Which do you think would useful variables to use in a model for house price? In this case study, we’ll only consider the variables price, sqft_living, and condition. An important thing to observe is that while the condition variable has values 1 through 5, these are saved in R as fct factors i.e. R’s way of saving categorical variables. So you should think of these as the “labels” 1 through 5 and not the numerical values 1 through 5.

Since price and sqft_living are numerical variables, an appropriate way to visualize of these variables’ distributions would be using a histogram using a geom_histogram() as seen in Section 3.5. However, since condition is categorical, a barplot using a geom_bar() yields an appropriate visualization of its distribution. Recall from Section 3.8 that since condition is not “pre-counted”, we use a geom_bar() and not a geom_col(). In Figure 12.3, we display all three of these visualizations at once. # Histogram of house price: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = price)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;price (USD)&quot;, title = &quot;House price&quot;) # Histogram of sqft_living: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = sqft_living)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;living space (square feet)&quot;, title = &quot;House size&quot;) # Barplot of condition: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = condition)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = &quot;condition&quot;, title = &quot;House condition&quot;) FIGURE 12.3: Exploratory visualizations of Seattle house prices data We observe the following: In the histogram for price: Since e+06 means \\(10^6\\), or one million, we see that a majority of houses are less than 2 million dollars. The x-axis stretches out far to the right to 8 million dollars, even though there appear to be no houses. In the histogram for size sqft_living Most houses appear to have less than 5000 square feet of living space. For comparison a standard American football field is about 57,600 square feet, where as a standard soccer AKA association football field is about 64,000 square feet. The x-axis exhibits the same stretched out behavior to the right as for price Most houses are of condition 3, 4, or 5. In the case of price, why does the x-axis stretch so far to the right? It is because there are a very small number of houses with price closer to 8 million; these prices are outliers in this case. We say variable is “right skewed” as exhibited by the long right tail. This skew makes it difficult to compare prices of the less expensive houses as the more expensive houses dominate the scale of the x-axis. This is similarly the case for sqft_living. Let’s now perform the third possible approach to EDA: computing summary statistics. In particular, let’s compute 4 summary statistics using the summarize() data wrangling verb from Section 4.3. Two measures of center: the mean and median Two measures of variability/spread: the standard deviation and interquartile-range (IQR = 3rd quartile - 1st quartile) house_prices %&gt;% summarize( mean_price = mean(price), median_price = median(price), sd_price = sd(price), IQR_price = IQR(price) ) # A tibble: 1 x 4 mean_price median_price sd_price IQR_price &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 540088. 450000 367127. 323050 Observe the following: The mean price of $540,088 is larger than the median of $450,000. This is because the small number of very expensive outlier houses prices are inflating the average, whereas since the median is the “middle” value, it is not as sensitive to such large values at the high end. This is why the news typically reports median house prices and not average house prices when describing the real estate market. We say here that the median more “robust to outliers” than the mean. Similarly, while both the standard deviation and IQR are both measures of spread and variability, the IQR is more “robust to outliers.” If you repeat the above summarize() for sqft_living, you’ll find a similar relationship between mean vs median and standard deviation vs IQR given its similar right-skewed nature. Is there anything we can do about this right-skew? Again, this could potentially be an issue because we’ll have a harder time discriminating between houses at the lower end of price and sqft_living, which might lead to a problem when modeling. We can in fact address this issue by using a log base 10 transformation, which we cover next. 12.1.2 log10 transformations At its simplest, log10() transformations returns base 10 logarithms. For example, since \\(1000 = 10^3\\), log10(1000) returns 3. To undo a log10-transformation, we raise 10 to this value. For example, to undo the previous log10-transformation and return the original value of 1000, we raise 10 to this value \\(10^{3}\\) by running 10^(3) = 1000. log-transformations allow us to focus on multiplicative changes instead of additive ones, thereby emphasizing changes in “orders of magnitude.” Let’s illustrate this idea in Table 12.1 with examples of prices of consumer goods in US dollars. TABLE 12.1: log10-transformed prices, orders of magnitude, and examples Price log10(Price) Order of magnitude Examples $1 0 Singles Cups of coffee $10 1 Tens Books $100 2 Hundreds Mobile phones $1,000 3 Thousands High definition TV’s $10,000 4 Tens of thousands Cars $100,000 5 Hundreds of thousands Luxury cars &amp; houses $1,000,000 6 Millions Luxury houses Let’s break this down: When purchasing a cup of coffee, we tend to think of prices ranging in single dollars e.g. $2 or $3. However when purchasing say mobile phones, we don’t tend to think in prices in single dollars e.g. $676 or $757, but tend to round to the nearest unit of hundreds of dollars e.g. $200 or $500. Let’s say we want to know the log10-transformed value of $76. Even if this would be hard to compute without a calculator, we know that its log10 value is between 1 and 2, since $76 is between $10 and $100. In fact, log10(76) is 1.880814. log10-transformations are monotonic, meaning they preserve orderings. So if Price A is lower than Price B, then log10(Price A) will also be lower than log10(Price B). Most importantly, increments of one in log10 correspond to multiplicative changes and not additive ones. For example, increasing from log10(Price) of 3 to 4 corresponds to a multiplicative increase by a factor of 10: $100 to $1000. Let’s create new log10-transformed versions of the right-skewed variable price and sqft_living using the mutate() function from Section 4.5, but we’ll give the latter the name log10_size, which is a little more succinct and descriptive a variable name. house_prices &lt;- house_prices %&gt;% mutate( log10_price = log10(price), log10_size = log10(sqft_living) ) Let’s first display the before and after effects of this transformation on these variables for only the first 10 rows of house_prices: house_prices %&gt;% select(price, log10_price, sqft_living, log10_size) # A tibble: 10 x 4 price log10_price sqft_living log10_size &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 221900 5.35 1180 3.07 2 538000 5.73 2570 3.41 3 180000 5.26 770 2.89 4 604000 5.78 1960 3.29 5 510000 5.71 1680 3.23 6 1225000 6.09 5420 3.73 7 257500 5.41 1715 3.23 8 291850 5.47 1060 3.03 9 229500 5.36 1780 3.25 10 323000 5.51 1890 3.28 Observe in particular: The house in the 6th row with price $1,225,000, which is just above one million dollars. Since \\(10^6\\) is one million, its log10_price is 6.09. Contrast this with all other houses with log10_price less than 6. Similarly, there is only one house with size sqft_living less than 1000. Since \\(1000 = 10^3\\), its the lone house with log10_size less than 3. Let’s now visualize the before and after effects of this transformation for price in Figure 12.4. # Before: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = price)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;price (USD)&quot;, title = &quot;House price: Before&quot;) # After: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_price)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;log10 price (USD)&quot;, title = &quot;House price: After&quot;) FIGURE 12.4: House price before and after log10-transformation Observe that after the transformation, the distribution is much less skewed, and in this case, more symmetric and bell-shaped, although this isn’t always necessarily the case. Now you can now better discriminate between house prices at the lower end of the scale. Let’s do the same for size where the before variable is sqft_living and the after variable is log10_size. Observe in Figure 12.5 that the log10-transformation has a similar effect of un-skewing the variable. Again, we emphasize that while in these two cases the resulting distributions are more symmetric and bell-shaped, this is not always necessarily the case. # Before: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = sqft_living)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;living space (square feet)&quot;, title = &quot;House size: Before&quot;) # After: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_size)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;log10 living space (square feet)&quot;, title = &quot;House size: After&quot;) FIGURE 12.5: House size before and after log10-transformation Given the now un-skewed nature of log10_price and log10_size, we are going to revise our modeling structure: We’ll use a new outcome variable \\(y\\) log10_price of houses The two explanatory/predictor variables we’ll use are: \\(x_1\\): A modified version of house size: log10_size \\(x_2\\): House condition will remain unchanged 12.1.3 EDA Part II Let’s continue our exploratory data analysis from Subsection 12.1.1 above. The earlier EDA you performed was univariate in nature in that we only considered one variable at a time. The goal of modeling, however, is to explore relationships between variables. So we must jointly consider the relationship between the outcome variable log10_price and the explanatory/predictor variables log10_size (numerical) and condition (categorical). We viewed such a modeling scenario in Section 7.2 using the evals dataset, where the outcome variable was teaching score, the numerical explanatory/predictor variable was instructor age and the categorical explanatory/predictor variable was (binary) gender. We have two possible visual models. Either a parallel slopes model in Figure 12.6 where we have a different regression line for each of the 5 possible condition levels, each with a different intercept but the same slope: FIGURE 12.6: Parallel slopes model Or an interaction model in Figure 12.7, where we allow each regression line to not only have different intercepts, but different slopes as well: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_size, y = log10_price, col = condition)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + labs(y = &quot;log10 price&quot;, x = &quot;log10 size&quot;, title = &quot;House prices in Seattle&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 12.7: Interaction model In both cases, we see there is a positive relationship between house price and size, meaning as houses are larger, they tend to be more expensive. Furthermore, in both plots it seems that houses of condition 5 tend to be the most expensive for most house sizes as evidenced by the fact that the purple line is highest, followed by condition 4 and 3. As for condition 1 and 2, this pattern isn’t as clear, as if you recall from the univariate barplot of condition in Figure 12.3 there are very few houses of condition 1 or 2. This reality is more apparent in an alternative visualization to Figure 12.7 displayed in Figure 12.8 that uses facets instead: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_size, y = log10_price, col = condition)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + labs(y = &quot;log10 price&quot;, x = &quot;log10 size&quot;, title = &quot;House prices in Seattle&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~condition) FIGURE 12.8: Interaction model with facets Which exploratory visualization of the interaction model is better, the one in Figure 12.7 or Figure 12.8? There is no universal right answer, you need to make a choice depending on what you want to convey, and own it. 12.1.4 Regression modeling For now let’s focus on the latter, interaction model we’ve visualized in Figure 12.8 above. What are the 5 different slopes and intercepts for the condition = 1, condition = 2, …, and condition = 5 lines in Figure 12.8? To determine these, we first need the values from the regression table: # Fit regression model: price_interaction &lt;- lm(log10_price ~ log10_size * condition, data = house_prices) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(price_interaction) # A tibble: 10 x 7 term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 intercept 3.33 0.451 7.38 0 2.45 4.22 2 log10_size 0.69 0.148 4.65 0 0.399 0.98 3 condition2 0.047 0.498 0.094 0.925 -0.93 1.02 4 condition3 -0.367 0.452 -0.812 0.417 -1.25 0.519 5 condition4 -0.398 0.453 -0.879 0.38 -1.29 0.49 6 condition5 -0.883 0.457 -1.93 0.053 -1.78 0.013 7 log10_size:condition2 -0.024 0.163 -0.148 0.882 -0.344 0.295 8 log10_size:condition3 0.133 0.148 0.893 0.372 -0.158 0.424 9 log10_size:condition4 0.146 0.149 0.979 0.328 -0.146 0.437 10 log10_size:condition5 0.31 0.15 2.07 0.039 0.016 0.604 Recall from Section 7.2.3 on how to interpret the outputs where there exists an interaction term, where in this case the “baseline for comparison” group for the categorical variable condition are the condition 1 houses. We’ll write our answers as: \\[\\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{size}} * \\log10(\\text{size})\\] for all five condition levels separately: Condition 1: \\(\\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = 3.33 + 0.69 * \\log10(\\text{size})\\) Condition 2: \\(\\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = (3.33 + 0.047) + (0.69 - 0.024) * \\log10(\\text{size}) = 3.38 + 0.666 * \\log10(\\text{size})\\) Condition 3: \\(\\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = (3.33 - 0.367) + (0.69 + 0.133) * \\log10(\\text{size}) = 2.96 + 0.823 * \\log10(\\text{size})\\) Condition 4: \\(\\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = (3.33 - 0.398) + (0.69 + 0.146) * \\log10(\\text{size}) = 2.93 + 0.836 * \\log10(\\text{size})\\) Condition 5: \\(\\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = (3.33 - 0.883) + (0.69 + 0.31) * \\log10(\\text{size}) = 2.45 + 1 * \\log10(\\text{size})\\) These correspond to the regression lines in the exploratory visualization of the interaction model in Figure 12.7 above. For homes of all 5 condition types, as the size of the house increases, the prices increases. This is what most would expect. However, the rate of increase of price with size is fastest for the homes with condition 3, 4, and 5 of 0.823, 0.836, and 1 respectively; these are the 3 most largest slopes out of the 5. 12.1.5 Making predictions Say you’re a realtor and someone calls you asking you how much their home will sell for. They tell you that it’s in condition = 5 and is sized 1900 square feet. What do you tell them? We first make this prediction visually in Figure 12.9. The predicted log10_price of this house is marked with a black dot: it is where the two following lines intersect: The purple regression line for the condition = 5 homes and The vertical dashed black line at log10_size equals 3.28, since our predictor variable is the log10-transformed square feet of living space and \\(\\log10(1900) = 3.28\\) . FIGURE 12.9: Interaction model with prediction Eyeballing it, it seems the predicted log10_price seems to be around 5.72. Let’s now obtain the an exact numerical value for the prediction using the values of the intercept and slope for the condition = 5 that we computed using the regression table output. We use the equation for the condition = 5 line, being sure to log10() the square footage first. 2.45 + 1 * log10(1900) [1] 5.73 This value is very close to our earlier visually made prediction of 5.72. But wait! We were using the outcome variable log10_price as our outcome variable! So if we want a prediction in terms of price in dollar units, we need to un-log this by taking a power of 10 as described in Section 12.1.2. 10^(2.45 + 1 * log10(1900)) [1] 535493 So we our predicted price for this home of condition 5 and size 1900 square feet is $535,493. Learning check (LC12.1) Repeat the regression modeling in Subsection 12.1.4 and the prediction making you just did on the house of condition 5 and size 1900 square feet in Subsection 12.1.5, but using the parallel slopes model you visualized in Figure 12.6. Hint: it’s $524,807! 12.2 Case study: Effective data storytelling Note: This section is still under construction. If you would like to contribute, please check us out on GitHub at https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book. As we’ve progressed throughout this book, you’ve seen how to work with data in a variety of ways. You’ve learned effective strategies for plotting data by understanding which types of plots work best for which combinations of variable types. You’ve summarized data in table form and calculated summary statistics for a variety of different variables. Further, you’ve seen the value of inference as a process to come to conclusions about a population by using a random sample. Lastly, you’ve explored how to use linear regression and the importance of checking the conditions required to make it a valid procedure. All throughout, you’ve learned many computational techniques and focused on reproducible research in writing R code. We now present another case study, but this time of the “effective data storytelling” done by data journalists around the world. Great data stories don’t mislead the reader, but rather engulf them in understanding the importance that data plays in our lives through the captivation of storytelling. 12.2.1 Bechdel test for Hollywood gender representation We recommend you read and analyze this article by Walt Hickey entitled The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women on the Bechdel test, an informal test of gender representation in a movie. As you read over it, think carefully about how Walt is using data, graphics, and analyses to paint the picture for the reader of what the story is he wants to tell. In the spirit of reproducibility, the members of FiveThirtyEight have also shared the data and R code that they used to create for this story and many more of their articles on GitHub. ModernDive co-authors Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim along with Jennifer Chunn went one step further by creating the fivethirtyeight R package. The fivethirtyeight package takes FiveThirtyEight’s article data from GitHub, “tames” it so that it’s novice-friendly, and makes all data, documentation, and the original article easily accessible via an R package. The package homepage also includes a list of all fivethirtyeight data sets included. Furthermore, example “vignettes” of fully reproducible start-to-finish analyses of some of these data using dplyr, ggplot2, and other packages in the tidyverse is available here. For example, a vignette showing how to reproduce one of the plots at the end of the above article on the Bechdel test is available here. 12.2.2 US Births in 1999 Here is another example involving the US_births_1994_2003 data frame of all births in the United States between 1994 and 2003. For more information on this data frame including a link to the original article on FiveThirtyEight.com, check out the help file by running ?US_births_1994_2003 in the console. First, let’s load all necessary packages: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(fivethirtyeight) It’s always a good idea to preview your data, either by using RStudio’s spreadsheet View() function or using glimpse() from the dplyr package below: # Preview data glimpse(US_births_1994_2003) Observations: 3,652 Variables: 6 $ year &lt;int&gt; 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1… $ month &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… $ date_of_month &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, … $ date &lt;date&gt; 1994-01-01, 1994-01-02, 1994-01-03, 1994-01-04, 1994-0… $ day_of_week &lt;ord&gt; Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tu… $ births &lt;int&gt; 8096, 7772, 10142, 11248, 11053, 11406, 11251, 8653, 79… We’ll focus on the number of births for each date, but only for births that occurred in 1999. Recall we achieve this using the filter() command from dplyr package: US_births_1999 &lt;- US_births_1994_2003 %&gt;% filter(year == 1999) Since date is a notion of time, which has a sequential ordering to it, a linegraph AKA a “time series” plot would be more appropriate than a scatterplot. In other words, use a geom_line() instead of geom_point(): ggplot(US_births_1999, aes(x = date, y = births)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Data&quot;, y = &quot;Number of births&quot;, title = &quot;US Births in 1999&quot;) We see a big valley occurring just before January 1st, 2000, mostly likely due to the holiday season. However, what about the major peak of over 14,000 births occurring just before October 1st, 1999? What could be the reason for this anomalously high spike in ? Time to think with data! 12.2.3 Other examples Stand by! 12.2.4 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. Concluding remarks If you’ve come to this point in the book, I’d suspect that you know a thing or two about how to work with data in R. You’ve also gained a lot of knowledge about how to use simulation techniques to determine statistical significance and how these techniques build an intuition about traditional inferential methods like the \\(t\\)-test. The hope is that you’ve come to appreciate data wrangling, tidy datasets, and the power of data visualization. Actually, the data visualization part may be the most important thing here. If you can create truly beautiful graphics that display information in ways that the reader can clearly decipher, you’ve picked up a great skill. Let’s hope that that skill keeps you creating great stories with data into the near and far distant future. Thanks for coming along for the ride as we dove into modern data analysis using R! "],
["A-appendixA.html", "A Statistical Background A.1 Basic statistical terms A.2 Normal distribution discussion", " A Statistical Background A.1 Basic statistical terms A.1.1 Mean The mean AKA average is the most commonly reported measure of center. It is commonly called the “average” though this term can be a little ambiguous. The mean is the sum of all of the data elements divided by how many elements there are. If we have \\(n\\) data points, the mean is given by: \\[Mean = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n}\\] A.1.2 Median The median is calculated by first sorting a variable’s data from smallest to largest. After sorting the data, the middle element in the list is the median. If the middle falls between two values, then the median is the mean of those two values. A.1.3 Standard deviation We will next discuss the standard deviation of a sample dataset pertaining to one variable. The formula can be a little intimidating at first but it is important to remember that it is essentially a measure of how far to expect a given data value is from its mean: \\[Standard \\, deviation = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}}\\] A.1.4 Five-number summary The five-number summary consists of five values: minimum, first quantile AKA 25th percentile, second quantile AKA median AKA 50th percentile, third quantile AKA 75th, and maximum. The quantiles are calculated as first quantile (\\(Q_1\\)): the median of the first half of the sorted data third quantile (\\(Q_3\\)): the median of the second half of the sorted data The interquartile range is defined as \\(Q_3 - Q_1\\) and is a measure of how spread out the middle 50% of values is. The five-number summary is not influenced by the presence of outliers in the ways that the mean and standard deviation are. It is, thus, recommended for skewed datasets. A.1.5 Distribution The distribution of a variable/dataset corresponds to generalizing patterns in the dataset. It often shows how frequently elements in the dataset appear. It shows how the data varies and gives some information about where a typical element in the data might fall. Distributions are most easily seen through data visualization. A.1.6 Outliers Outliers correspond to values in the dataset that fall far outside the range of “ordinary” values. In regards to a boxplot (by default), they correspond to values below \\(Q_1 - (1.5 * IQR)\\) or above \\(Q_3 + (1.5 * IQR)\\). Note that these terms (aside from Distribution) only apply to quantitative variables. A.2 Normal distribution discussion "],

B.2 One mean B.2.1 Problem statement The National Survey of Family Growth conducted by the Centers for Disease Control gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health. One of the variables collected on this survey is the age at first marriage. 5,534 randomly sampled US women between 2006 and 2010 completed the survey. The women sampled here had been married at least once. Do we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years? (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 4]) B.2.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is equal to 23 years. Alternative hypothesis: The mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_{0}\\), where \\(\\mu\\) represents the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 and \\(\\mu_0\\) is 23. \\(H_A: \\mu &gt; 23\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.2.3 Exploring the sample data age_at_marriage &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/ageAtMar.csv&quot;) age_summ &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% summarize(sample_size = n(), mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age), minimum = min(age), lower_quartile = quantile(age, 0.25), median = median(age), upper_quartile = quantile(age, 0.75), max = max(age)) kable(age_summ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16), latex_options = c(&quot;HOLD_position&quot;)) sample_size mean sd minimum lower_quartile median upper_quartile max 5534 23.4 4.72 10 20 23 26 43 The histogram below also shows the distribution of age. ggplot(data = age_at_marriage, mapping = aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, color = &quot;white&quot;) The observed statistic of interest here is the sample mean: x_bar &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) x_bar # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 23.4 Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \\(\\mu_0 = 23\\). They seem to be quite close, but we have a large sample size here. Let’s guess that the large sample size will lead us to reject this practically small difference. B.2.4 Non-traditional methods Bootstrapping for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \\(\\mu_0 = 23\\), we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 5534 was selected. We can use the idea of bootstrapping to simulate the population from which the sample came and then generate samples from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. Recall how bootstrapping would apply in this context: Sample with replacement from our original sample of 5534 women and repeat this process 10,000 times, calculate the mean for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1., combine all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a boot_distn object, and shift the center of this distribution over to the null value of 23. (This is needed since it will be centered at 23.44 via the process of bootstrapping.) set.seed(2018) null_distn_one_mean &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, mu = 23) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a right-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to 23.44 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 x 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu\\) using our sample data using bootstrapping. Note that we don’t need to shift this distribution since we want the center of our confidence interval to be our point estimate \\(\\bar{x}_{obs} = 23.44\\). boot_distn_one_mean &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) ci &lt;- boot_distn_one_mean %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 23.3 23.6 boot_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 23 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu\\) (the unknown population mean) and the entire interval is larger than 23. This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (\\(\\mu &gt; 23\\)). Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is between 23.316 and 23.565. B.2.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are collected independently. The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The distribution of the response variable should be normal or the sample size should be at least 30. The histogram for the sample above does show some skew. The Q-Q plot below also shows some skew. ggplot(data = age_at_marriage, mapping = aes(sample = age)) + stat_qq() The sample size here is quite large though (\\(n = 5534\\)) so both conditions are met. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean \\(\\mu\\). A good guess is the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}_{obs} = 23.44\\) or larger assuming that the population mean is 23 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can “standardize” this original test statistic of \\(\\bar{X}\\) into a \\(T\\) statistic that follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 1\\): \\[ T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{ S / \\sqrt{n} } \\sim t (df = n - 1) \\] where \\(S\\) represents the standard deviation of the sample and \\(n\\) is the sample size. Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the t_test() function to perform this analysis for us. t_test_results &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% infer::t_test(formula = age ~ NULL, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, mu = 23) t_test_results # A tibble: 1 x 6 statistic t_df p_value alternative lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 6.94 5533 2.25e-12 greater 23.3 Inf We see here that the \\(t_{obs}\\) value is 6.936. Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(t_{obs}\\) value of 6.936 or more in our null distribution of a \\(t\\) with 5533 degrees of freedom—is essentially 0. State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean was statistically greater than the hypothesized mean has supporting evidence here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years. Confidence interval t.test(x = age_at_marriage$age, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, mu = 23)$conf [1] 23.3 23.6 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.95 B.2.6 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met (the large sample size was the driver here) leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.3 One proportion B.3.1 Problem statement The CEO of a large electric utility claims that 80 percent of his 1,000,000 customers are satisfied with the service they receive. To test this claim, the local newspaper surveyed 100 customers, using simple random sampling. 73 were satisfied and the remaining were unsatisfied. Based on these findings from the sample, can we reject the CEO’s hypothesis that 80% of the customers are satisfied? [Tweaked a bit from http://stattrek.com/hypothesis-test/proportion.aspx?Tutorial=AP] B.3.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is equal 0.80. Alternative hypothesis: The proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is different from 0.80. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\pi = p_{0}\\), where \\(\\pi\\) represents the proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive and \\(p_0\\) is 0.8. \\(H_A: \\pi \\ne 0.8\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.3.3 Exploring the sample data elec &lt;- c(rep(&quot;satisfied&quot;, 73), rep(&quot;unsatisfied&quot;, 27)) %&gt;% as_data_frame() %&gt;% rename(satisfy = value) The bar graph below also shows the distribution of satisfy. ggplot(data = elec, aes(x = satisfy)) + geom_bar() The observed statistic is computed as p_hat &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) p_hat # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.73 Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the sample proportion of 0.73 is statistically different from \\(p_0 = 0.8\\) based on this sample. They seem to be quite close, and our sample size is not huge here (\\(n = 100\\)). Let’s guess that we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis. B.3.4 Non-traditional methods Simulation for hypothesis test In order to look to see if 0.73 is statistically different from 0.8, we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 100 was selected. We can use the idea of an unfair coin to simulate this process. We will simulate flipping an unfair coin (with probability of success 0.8 matching the null hypothesis) 100 times. Then we will keep track of how many heads come up in those 100 flips. Our simulated statistic matches with how we calculated the original statistic \\(\\hat{p}\\): the number of heads (satisfied) out of our total sample of 100. We then repeat this process many times (say 10,000) to create the null distribution looking at the simulated proportions of successes: set.seed(2018) null_distn_one_prop &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, p = 0.8) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are 0.8 - 0.73 = 0.07 away from 0.8 in BOTH directions for our \\(p\\)-value: null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 x 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.114 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0.114 and we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\pi\\) using our sample data. To do so, we use bootstrapping, which involves sampling with replacement from our original sample of 100 survey respondents and repeating this process 10,000 times, calculating the proportion of successes for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1., combining all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a boot_distn object, identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of this distribution (corresponding to the 5% significance level chosen) to find a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\pi\\), and interpret this confidence interval in the context of the problem. boot_distn_one_prop &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) Just as we use the mean function for calculating the mean over a numerical variable, we can also use it to compute the proportion of successes for a categorical variable where we specify what we are calling a “success” after the ==. (Think about the formula for calculating a mean and how R handles logical statements such as satisfy == &quot;satisfied&quot; for why this must be true.) ci &lt;- boot_distn_one_prop %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.64 0.81 boot_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0.80 is contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\pi\\) (the unknown population proportion). This matches with our hypothesis test results of failing to reject the null hypothesis. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true proportion of customers who are satisfied with the service they receive is between 0.64 and 0.81. B.3.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are collected independently. The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The number of expected successes and expected failures is at least 10. This condition is met since 73 and 27 are both greater than 10. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population proportion \\(\\pi\\). A good guess is the sample proportion \\(\\hat{P}\\). Recall that this sample proportion is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample proportion of \\(\\hat{p}_{obs} = 0.73\\) or larger assuming that the population proportion is 0.80 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can standardize this original test statistic of \\(\\hat{P}\\) into a \\(Z\\) statistic that follows a \\(N(0, 1)\\) distribution. \\[ Z =\\dfrac{ \\hat{P} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n} }} \\sim N(0, 1) \\] Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand” by plugging the observed values into the formula, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. The calculation has been done in R below for completeness though: p_hat &lt;- 0.73 p0 &lt;- 0.8 n &lt;- 100 (z_obs &lt;- (p_hat - p0) / sqrt( (p0 * (1 - p0)) / n)) [1] -1.75 We see here that the \\(z_{obs}\\) value is around -1.75. Our observed sample proportion of 0.73 is 1.75 standard errors below the hypothesized parameter value of 0.8. Visualize and compute \\(p\\)-value elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, p = 0.8) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;z&quot;) %&gt;% visualize(method = &quot;theoretical&quot;, obs_stat = z_obs, direction = &quot;both&quot;) 2 * pnorm(z_obs) [1] 0.0801 The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(z_{obs}\\) value of -1.75 or more extreme (in both directions) in our null distribution—is around 8%. Note that we could also do this test directly using the prop.test function. stats::prop.test(x = table(elec$satisfy), n = length(elec$satisfy), alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, p = 0.8, correct = FALSE) 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction data: table(elec$satisfy), null probability 0.8 X-squared = 3, df = 1, p-value = 0.08 alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.8 95 percent confidence interval: 0.636 0.807 sample estimates: p 0.73 prop.test does a \\(\\chi^2\\) test here but this matches up exactly with what we would expect: \\(x^2_{obs} = 3.06 = (-1.75)^2 = (z_{obs})^2\\) and the \\(p\\)-values are the same because we are focusing on a two-tailed test. Note that the 95 percent confidence interval given above matches well with the one calculated using bootstrapping. State conclusion We, therefore, do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample proportion was not statistically greater than the hypothesized proportion has not been invalidated. Based on this sample, we have do not evidence that the proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is different from 0.80, at the 5% level. B.3.6 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.4 Two proportions B.4.1 Problem statement A 2010 survey asked 827 randomly sampled registered voters in California “Do you support? Or do you oppose? Drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California? Or do you not know enough to say?” Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the data provide strong evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do not have an opinion on this issue is different than that of non-college graduates. (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 6]) B.4.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: There is no association between having an opinion on drilling and having a college degree for all registered California voters in 2010. Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between having an opinion on drilling and having a college degree for all registered California voters in 2010. Another way in words Null hypothesis: The probability that a Californian voter in 2010 having no opinion on drilling and is a college graduate is the same as that of a non-college graduate. Alternative hypothesis: These parameter probabilities are different. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\pi_{college} = \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) or \\(H_0: \\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college} = 0\\), where \\(\\pi\\) represents the probability of not having an opinion on drilling. \\(H_A: \\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college} \\ne 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.4.3 Exploring the sample data offshore &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/offshore.csv&quot;) offshore %&gt;% tabyl(college_grad, response) college_grad no opinion opinion no 131 258 yes 104 334 off_summ &lt;- offshore %&gt;% group_by(college_grad) %&gt;% summarize(prop_no_opinion = mean(response == &quot;no opinion&quot;), sample_size = n()) ggplot(offshore, aes(x = college_grad, fill = response)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;) + coord_flip() Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if a difference exists in the size of the bars corresponding to no opinion for the plot. Based solely on the plot, we have little reason to believe that a difference exists since the bars seem to be about the same size, BUT…it’s important to use statistics to see if that difference is actually statistically significant! B.4.4 Non-traditional methods Collecting summary info The observed statistic is d_hat &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) d_hat # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.0993 Randomization for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample proportion of no opinion for college graduates of 0.337 is statistically different than that for graduates of 0.237, we need to account for the sample sizes. Note that this is the same as looking to see if \\(\\hat{p}_{grad} - \\hat{p}_{nograd}\\) is statistically different than 0. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 389 and 438 were selected. We can use the idea of randomization testing (also known as permutation testing) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using shuffling from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. set.seed(2018) null_distn_two_props &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) null_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to -0.099 or less than or equal to 0.099 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;two_sided&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_two_props %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;two_sided&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 x 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.003 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0.003 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the tails of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) using our sample data with bootstrapping. boot_distn_two_props &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) ci &lt;- boot_distn_two_props %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.161 -0.0378 boot_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter, we have evidence that the proportion of college graduates in California with no opinion on drilling is different than that of non-college graduates. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true proportion of non-college graduates with no opinion on offshore drilling in California is between 0.16 dollars smaller to 0.04 dollars smaller than for college graduates. B.4.5 Traditional methods B.4.6 Check conditions Remember that in order to use the short-cut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: Each case that was selected must be independent of all the other cases selected. This condition is met since cases were selected at random to observe. Sample size: The number of pooled successes and pooled failures must be at least 10 for each group. We need to first figure out the pooled success rate: \\[\\hat{p}_{obs} = \\dfrac{131 + 104}{827} = 0.28.\\] We now determine expected (pooled) success and failure counts: \\(0.28 \\cdot (131 + 258) = 108.92\\), \\(0.72 \\cdot (131 + 258) = 280.08\\) \\(0.28 \\cdot (104 + 334) = 122.64\\), \\(0.72 \\cdot (104 + 334) = 315.36\\) Independent selection of samples: The cases are not paired in any meaningful way. We have no reason to suspect that a college graduate selected would have any relationship to a non-college graduate selected. B.4.7 Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we are interested in seeing if our observed difference in sample proportions corresponding to no opinion on drilling (\\(\\hat{p}_{college, obs} - \\hat{p}_{no\\_college, obs}\\) = 0.033) is statistically different than 0. Assuming that conditions are met and the null hypothesis is true, we can use the standard normal distribution to standardize the difference in sample proportions (\\(\\hat{P}_{college} - \\hat{P}_{no\\_college}\\)) using the standard error of \\(\\hat{P}_{college} - \\hat{P}_{no\\_college}\\) and the pooled estimate: \\[ Z =\\dfrac{ (\\hat{P}_1 - \\hat{P}_2) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\hat{P}(1 - \\hat{P})}{n_1} + \\dfrac{\\hat{P}(1 - \\hat{P})}{n_2} }} \\sim N(0, 1) \\] where \\(\\hat{P} = \\dfrac{\\text{total number of successes} }{ \\text{total number of cases}}.\\) Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the prop.test function to perform this analysis for us. z_hat &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;z&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) z_hat # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -3.16 The observed difference in sample proportions is 3.16 standard deviations smaller than 0. The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing a \\(Z\\) value of -3.16 or more extreme in our null distribution—is 0.0016. This can also be calculated in R directly: 2 * pnorm(-3.16, lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.00158 B.4.8 State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that a statistically significant difference did not exist in the proportions of no opinion on offshore drilling between college educated and non-college educated Californians was not validated. We do have evidence to suggest that there is a dependency between college graduation and position on offshore drilling for Californians. B.4.9 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results. B.5 Two means (independent samples) B.5.1 Problem statement Average income varies from one region of the country to another, and it often reflects both lifestyles and regional living expenses. Suppose a new graduate is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and he wants to see whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other. He would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on two randomly selected samples from the 2000 Census. (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 5]) B.5.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: There is no association between income and location (Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA). Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between income and location (Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA). Another way in words Null hypothesis: The mean income is the same for both cities. Alternative hypothesis: The mean income is different for the two cities. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu_{sac} = \\mu_{cle}\\) or \\(H_0: \\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle} = 0\\), where \\(\\mu\\) represents the average income. \\(H_A: \\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle} \\ne 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.5.3 Exploring the sample data cle_sac &lt;- read.delim(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/cleSac.txt&quot;) %&gt;% rename(metro_area = Metropolitan_area_Detailed, income = Total_personal_income) %&gt;% na.omit() inc_summ &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% group_by(metro_area) %&gt;% summarize(sample_size = n(), mean = mean(income), sd = sd(income), minimum = min(income), lower_quartile = quantile(income, 0.25), median = median(income), upper_quartile = quantile(income, 0.75), max = max(income)) kable(inc_summ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16), latex_options = c(&quot;HOLD_position&quot;)) metro_area sample_size mean sd minimum lower_quartile median upper_quartile max Cleveland_ OH 212 27467 27681 0 8475 21000 35275 152400 Sacramento_ CA 175 32428 35774 0 8050 20000 49350 206900 The boxplot below also shows the mean for each group highlighted by the red dots. ggplot(cle_sac, aes(x = metro_area, y = income)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun.y = &quot;mean&quot;, geom = &quot;point&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;) Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if a difference exists in the mean income of the two levels of the explanatory variable. Based solely on the boxplot, we have reason to believe that no difference exists. The distributions of income seem similar and the means fall in roughly the same place. B.5.4 Non-traditional methods Collecting summary info We now compute the observed statistic: d_hat &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;)) d_hat # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 4960. Randomization for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean for Sacramento of 27467.066 is statistically different than that for Cleveland of 32427.543, we need to account for the sample sizes. Note that this is the same as looking to see if \\(\\bar{x}_{sac} - \\bar{x}_{cle}\\) is statistically different than 0. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 212 and 175 were selected. We can use the idea of randomization testing (also known as permutation testing) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using shuffling from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. set.seed(2018) null_distn_two_means &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;)) null_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to 4960.477 or less than or equal to -4960.477 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_two_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 x 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.130 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0.13 and we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are not very far into the tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle}\\) using our sample data with bootstrapping. Here we will bootstrap each of the groups with replacement instead of shuffling. This is done using the groups argument in the resample function to fix the size of each group to be the same as the original group sizes of 175 for Sacramento and 212 for Cleveland. boot_distn_two_means &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;)) ci &lt;- boot_distn_two_means %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -1446. 11308. boot_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0 is contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of failing to reject the null hypothesis. Since zero is a plausible value of the population parameter, we do not have evidence that Sacramento incomes are different than Cleveland incomes. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean yearly income for those living in Sacramento is between 1445.53 dollars smaller to 11307.82 dollars higher than for Cleveland. Note: You could also use the null distribution based on randomization with a shift to have its center at \\(\\bar{x}_{sac} - \\bar{x}_{cle} = \\$4960.48\\) instead of at 0 and calculate its percentiles. The confidence interval produced via this method should be comparable to the one done using bootstrapping above. B.5.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the short-cut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are independent in both groups. This metro_area variable is met since the cases are randomly selected from each city. Approximately normal: The distribution of the response for each group should be normal or the sample sizes should be at least 30. ggplot(cle_sac, aes(x = income)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, binwidth = 20000) + facet_wrap(~ metro_area) We have some reason to doubt the normality assumption here since both the histograms show deviation from a normal model fitting the data well for each group. The sample sizes for each group are greater than 100 though so the assumptions should still apply. Independent samples: The samples should be collected without any natural pairing. There is no mention of there being a relationship between those selected in Cleveland and in Sacramento. B.5.6 Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we are interested in seeing if our observed difference in sample means (\\(\\bar{x}_{sac, obs} - \\bar{x}_{cle, obs}\\) = 4960.477) is statistically different than 0. Assuming that conditions are met and the null hypothesis is true, we can use the \\(t\\) distribution to standardize the difference in sample means (\\(\\bar{X}_{sac} - \\bar{X}_{cle}\\)) using the approximate standard error of \\(\\bar{X}_{sac} - \\bar{X}_{cle}\\) (invoking \\(S_{sac}\\) and \\(S_{cle}\\) as estimates of unknown \\(\\sigma_{sac}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{cle}\\)). \\[ T =\\dfrac{ (\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - 0}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{S_1^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{S_2^2}{n_2}} } \\sim t (df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1)) \\] where 1 = Sacramento and 2 = Cleveland with \\(S_1^2\\) and \\(S_2^2\\) the sample variance of the incomes of both cities, respectively, and \\(n_1 = 175\\) for Sacramento and \\(n_2 = 212\\) for Cleveland. Observed test statistic Note that we could also do (ALMOST) this test directly using the t.test function. The x and y arguments are expected to both be numeric vectors here so we’ll need to appropriately filter our datasets. cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;, &quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -1.50 We see here that the observed test statistic value is around -1.5. While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. B.5.7 Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(t_{174}\\) value of -1.501 or more extreme (in both directions) in our null distribution—is 0.13. This can also be calculated in R directly: 2 * pt(-1.501, df = min(212 - 1, 175 - 1), lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.135 We can also approximate by using the standard normal curve: 2 * pnorm(-1.501) [1] 0.133 Note that the 95 percent confidence interval given above matches well with the one calculated using bootstrapping. B.5.8 State conclusion We, therefore, do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that a statistically significant difference not existing in the means was backed by this statistical analysis. We do not have evidence to suggest that the true mean income differs between Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA based on this data. B.5.9 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.6 Two means (paired samples) Problem statement Trace metals in drinking water affect the flavor and an unusually high concentration can pose a health hazard. Ten pairs of data were taken measuring zinc concentration in bottom water and surface water at 10 randomly selected locations on a stretch of river. Do the data suggest that the true average concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of bottom water? (Note that units are not given.) [Tweaked a bit from https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat500/node/51] B.6.1 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The mean concentration in the bottom water is the same as that of the surface water at different paired locations. Alternative hypothesis: The mean concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of the bottom water at different paired locations. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu_{diff} = 0\\), where \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) represents the mean difference in concentration for surface water minus bottom water. \\(H_A: \\mu_{diff} &lt; 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.6.2 Exploring the sample data zinc_tidy &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/zinc_tidy.csv&quot;) We want to look at the differences in surface - bottom for each location: zinc_diff &lt;- zinc_tidy %&gt;% group_by(loc_id) %&gt;% summarize(pair_diff = diff(concentration)) %&gt;% ungroup() Next we calculate the mean difference as our observed statistic: d_hat &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) d_hat # A tibble: 1 x 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.0804 The histogram below also shows the distribution of pair_diff. ggplot(zinc_diff, aes(x = pair_diff)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, color = &quot;white&quot;) Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the sample paired mean difference of -0.08 is statistically less than 0. They seem to be quite close, but we have a small number of pairs here. Let’s guess that we will fail to reject the null hypothesis. B.6.3 Non-traditional methods Bootstrapping for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean difference \\(\\bar{x}_{diff} = 4960.477\\) is statistically less than 0, we need to account for the number of pairs. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the paired data was selected in a way similar to how we calculated our original difference in sample means. Treating the differences as our data of interest, we next use the process of bootstrapping to build other simulated samples and then calculate the mean of the bootstrap samples. We hypothesize that the mean difference is zero. This process is similar to comparing the One Mean example seen above, but using the differences between the two groups as a single sample with a hypothesized mean difference of 0. set.seed(2018) null_distn_paired_means &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, mu = 0) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a left-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are less than or equal to 4960.477 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;less&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;less&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 x 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 So our \\(p\\)-value is essentially 0 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the left tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) using our sample data (the calculated differences) with bootstrapping. This is similar to the bootstrapping done in a one sample mean case, except now our data is differences instead of raw numerical data. Note that this code is identical to the pipeline shown in the hypothesis test above except the hypothesize() function is not called. boot_distn_paired_means &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) ci &lt;- boot_distn_paired_means %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 `2.5%` `97.5%` &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.112 -0.0503 boot_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter and since the entire confidence interval falls below zero, we have evidence that surface zinc concentration levels are lower, on average, than bottom level zinc concentrations. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean zinc concentration on the surface is between 0.11 units smaller to 0.05 units smaller than on the bottom. B.6.4 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations among pairs are independent. The locations are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The distribution of population of differences is normal or the number of pairs is at least 30. The histogram above does show some skew so we have reason to doubt the population being normal based on this sample. We also only have 10 pairs which is fewer than the 30 needed. A theory-based test may not be valid here. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean difference \\(\\mu_{diff}\\). A good guess is the sample mean difference \\(\\bar{X}_{diff}\\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff, obs} = 0.0804\\) or larger assuming that the population mean difference is 0 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can “standardize” this original test statistic of \\(\\bar{X}_{diff}\\) into a \\(T\\) statistic that follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 1\\): \\[ T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{X}_{diff} - 0}{ S_{diff} / \\sqrt{n} } \\sim t (df = n - 1) \\] where \\(S\\) represents the standard deviation of the sample differences and \\(n\\) is the number of pairs. Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the t_test function on the differences to perform this analysis for us. t_test_results &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% infer::t_test(formula = pair_diff ~ NULL, alternative = &quot;less&quot;, mu = 0) t_test_results # A tibble: 1 x 6 statistic t_df p_value alternative lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -4.86 9 0.000446 less -Inf -0.0501 We see here that the \\(t_{obs}\\) value is -4.864. Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing a \\(t_{obs}\\) value of -4.864 or less in our null distribution of a \\(t\\) with 9 degrees of freedom—is 0. This can also be calculated in R directly: pt(-4.8638, df = nrow(zinc_diff) - 1, lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.000446 State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean difference was not statistically less than the hypothesized mean of 0 has been invalidated here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean concentration in the bottom water is greater than that of the surface water at different paired locations. B.6.5 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results here. References "],

This allows the reader to more easily compare the ordering of different airlines in terms of departed flights (Robbins 2013). We can also much more easily answer questions like “How many airlines have more departing flights than Southwest Airlines?”. We can use the sorted table giving the number of flights defined as sorted_flights to reorder the carrier. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() + scale_x_discrete(limits = names(sorted_flights)) FIGURE C.1: Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline - Descending numbers The last addition here specifies the values of the horizontal x axis on a discrete scale to correspond to those given by the entries of sorted_flights. C.2 Interactive graphics C.2.1 Interactive linegraphs Another useful tool for viewing linegraphs such as this is the dygraph function in the dygraphs package in combination with the dyRangeSelector function. This allows us to zoom in on a selected range and get an interactive plot for us to work with: library(dygraphs) flights_day &lt;- mutate(flights, date = as.Date(time_hour)) flights_summarized &lt;- flights_day %&gt;% group_by(date) %&gt;% summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) rownames(flights_summarized) &lt;- flights_summarized$date flights_summarized &lt;- select(flights_summarized, -date) dyRangeSelector(dygraph(flights_summarized)) The syntax here is a little different than what we have covered so far. The dygraph function is expecting for the dates to be given as the rownames of the object. We then remove the date variable from the flights_summarized data frame since it is accounted for in the rownames. Lastly, we run the dygraph function on the new data frame that only contains the median arrival delay as a column and then provide the ability to have a selector to zoom in on the interactive plot via dyRangeSelector.

This will install the earlier mentioned dplyr package, the nycflights13 package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a NYC airport in 2013, and the knitr package for writing reports in R. (LC2.2) “Load” the dplyr, nycflights13, and knitr packages as well by repeating the above steps. Solution: If the following code runs with no errors, you’ve succeeded! library(dplyr) library(nycflights13) library(knitr) (LC2.3) What does any ONE row in this flights dataset refer to? A. Data on an airline B. Data on a flight C. Data on an airport D. Data on multiple flights Solution: This is data on a flight. Not a flight path! Example: a flight path would be United 1545 to Houston a flight would be United 1545 to Houston at a specific date/time. For example: 2013/1/1 at 5:15am. (LC2.4) What are some examples in this dataset of categorical variables? What makes them different than quantitative variables? Solution: Hint: Type ?flights in the console to see what all the variables mean! Categorical: carrier the company dest the destination flight the flight number. Even though this is a number, its simply a label. Example United 1545 is not less than United 1714 Quantitative: distance the distance in miles time_hour time (LC2.5) What does int, dbl, and chr mean in the output above? Solution: int: integer. Used to count things i.e. a discrete value. Ex: the # of cars parked in a lot dbl: double. Used to measure things. i.e. a continuous value. Ex: your height in inches chr: character. i.e. text (LC2.6) What properties of the observational unit do each of lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, and tzone describe for the airports data frame? Note that you may want to use ?airports to get more information. Solution: lat long represent the airport geographic coordinates, alt is the altitude above sea level of the airport (Run airports %&gt;% filter(faa == &quot;DEN&quot;) to see the altitude of Denver International Airport), tz is the time zone difference with respect to GMT in London UK, dst is the daylight savings time zone, and tzone is the time zone label. (LC2.7) Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables in which one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not. In other words, create your own tidy dataset that matches these conditions. Solution: In the weather example in LC3.8, the combination of origin, year, month, day, hour are identification variables as they identify the observation in question. Anything else pertains to observations: temp, humid, wind_speed, etc. D.2 Chapter 3 Solutions library(nycflights13) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) (LC3.1) Take a look at both the flights and alaska_flights data frames by running View(flights) and View(alaska_flights) in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? Solution: flights contains all flight data, while alaska_flights contains only data from Alaskan carrier “AS”. We can see that flights has 336776 rows while alaska_flights has only 714 (LC3.2) What are some practical reasons why dep_delay and arr_delay have a positive relationship? Solution: The later a plane departs, typically the later it will arrive. (LC3.3) What variables (not necessarily in the flights data frame) would you expect to have a negative correlation (i.e. a negative relationship) with dep_delay? Why? Remember that we are focusing on numerical variables here. Solution: An example in the weather dataset is visibility, which measure visibility in miles. As visibility increases, we would expect departure delays to decrease. (LC3.4) Why do you believe there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Alaskan flights? Solution: The point (0,0) means no delay in departure nor arrival. From the point of view of Alaska airlines, this means the flight was on time. It seems most flights are at least close to being on time. (LC3.5) What are some other features of the plot that stand out to you? Solution: Different people will answer this one differently. One answer is most flights depart and arrive less than an hour late. (LC3.6) Create a new scatterplot using different variables in the alaska_flights data frame by modifying the example above. Solution: Many possibilities for this one, see the plot below. Is there a pattern in departure delay depending on when the flight is scheduled to depart? Interestingly, there seems to be only two blocks of time where flights depart. ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_time, y = dep_delay)) + geom_point() (LC3.7) Why is setting the alpha argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? Solution: Why is setting the alpha argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? It thins out the points so we address overplotting. But more importantly it hints at the (statistical) density and distribution of the points: where are the points concentrated, where do they occur. We will see more about densities and distributions in Chapter 6 when we switch gears to statistical topics. (LC3.8) After viewing the Figure 3.4 above, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur the most frequently. How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the alpha = 0.2 set in Figure 3.2? Solution: After viewing the Figure 3.4 above, give a range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur most frequently? How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the alpha = 0.2 set in Figure 3.2? The lower plot suggests that most Alaska flights from NYC depart between 12 minutes early and on time and arrive between 50 minutes early and on time. (LC3.9) Take a look at both the weather and early_january_weather data frames by running View(weather) and View(early_january_weather) in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? Solution: Take a look at both the weather and early_january_weather data frames by running View(weather) and View(early_january_weather) in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? The rows of early_january_weather are a subset of weather. (LC3.10) View() the flights data frame again. Why does the time_hour variable uniquely identify the hour of the measurement whereas the hour variable does not? Solution: View() the flights data frame again. Why does the time_hour variable correctly identify the hour of the measurement whereas the hour variable does not? Because to uniquely identify an hour, we need the year/month/day/hour sequence, whereas there are only 24 possible hour’s. (LC3.11) Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? Solution: Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? Because lines suggest connectedness and ordering. (LC3.12) Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable? Solution: Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable? Because time is sequential: subsequent observations are closely related to each other. (LC3.13) Plot a time series of a variable other than temp for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013. Solution: Plot a time series of a variable other than temp for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013. Humidity is a good one to look at, since this very closely related to the cycles of a day. ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = humid)) + geom_line() (LC3.14) What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 40 tell us about the distribution of temperatures? Solution: The distribution doesn’t change much. But by refining the bin width, we see that the temperature data has a high degree of accuracy. What do I mean by accuracy? Looking at the temp variabile by View(weather), we see that the precision of each temperature recording is 2 decimal places. (LC3.15) Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed? Solution: It is rather symmetric, i.e. there are no long tails on only one side of the distribution (LC3.16) What would you guess is the “center” value in this distribution? Why did you make that choice? Solution: The center is around 55.26°F. By running the summary() command, we see that the mean and median are very similar. In fact, when the distribution is symmetric the mean equals the median. (LC3.17) Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close? Why? Solution: This can only be answered relatively speaking! Let’s pick things to be relative to Seattle, WA temperatures: While, it appears that Seattle weather has a similar center of 55°F, its temperatures are almost entirely between 35°F and 75°F for a range of about 40°F. Seattle temperatures are much less spread out than New York i.e. much more consistent over the year. New York on the other hand has much colder days in the winter and much hotter days in the summer. Expressed differently, the middle 50% of values, as delineated by the interquartile range is 30°F: (LC3.18) What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above? How does a faceted plot help us see relationships between two variables? Solution: Certain months have much more consistent weather (August in particular), while others have crazy variability like January and October, representing changes in the seasons. Because we see temp recordings split by month, we are considering the relationship between these two variables. For example, for example for summer months, temperatures tend to be higher. (LC3.19) What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above? What about 25, 50, 75, 100? Solution: While month is technically a number between 1-12, we’re viewing it as a categorical variable here. Specifically an ordinal categorical variable since there is a ordering to the categories 25, 50, 75, 100 are temperatures (LC3.20) For which types of data-sets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the nature of these variables and other important characteristics. Solution: We’d have 365 facets to look at. Way too many. We don’t really care about day-to-day fluctuation in weather so much, but maybe more week-to-week variation. We’d like to focus on seasonal trends. (LC3.21) Does the temp variable in the weather data-set have a lot of variability? Why do you say that? Solution: Again, like in LC (LC3.17), this is a relative question. I would say yes, because in New York City, you have 4 clear seasons with different weather. Whereas in Seattle WA and Portland OR, you have two seasons: summer and rain! (LC3.22) What does the dot at the bottom of the plot for May correspond to? Explain what might have occurred in May to produce this point. Solution: It appears to be an outlier. Let’s revisit the use of the filter command to hone in on it. We want all data points where the month is 5 and temp&lt;25 weather %&gt;% filter(month==5 &amp; temp &lt; 25) # A tibble: 1 x 16 origin year month day hour temp dewp humid wind_dir wind_speed wind_gust &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 JFK 2013 5 8 22 13.1 12.0 95.3 80 8.06 NA # … with 5 more variables: precip &lt;dbl&gt;, pressure &lt;dbl&gt;, visib &lt;dbl&gt;, # time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;, temp_in_C &lt;dbl&gt; There appears to be only one hour and only at JFK that recorded 13.1 F (-10.5 C) in the month of May. This is probably a data entry mistake! Why wasn’t the weather at least similar at EWR (Newark) and LGA (La Guardia)? (LC3.23) Which months have the highest variability in temperature? What reasons do you think this is? Solution: We are now interested in the spread of the data. One measure some of you may have seen previously is the standard deviation. But in this plot we can read off the Interquartile Range (IQR): The distance from the 1st to the 3rd quartiles i.e. the length of the boxes You can also think of this as the spread of the middle 50% of the data Just from eyeballing it, it seems November has the biggest IQR, i.e. the widest box, so has the most variation in temperature August has the smallest IQR, i.e. the narrowest box, so is the most consistent temperature-wise Here’s how we compute the exact IQR values for each month (we’ll see this more in depth Chapter 5 of the text): group the observations by month then for each group, i.e. month, summarize it by applying the summary statistic function IQR(), while making sure to skip over missing data via na.rm=TRUE then arrange the table in descending order of IQR weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(IQR = IQR(temp, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(IQR)) month IQR 11 16.02 12 14.04 1 13.77 9 12.06 4 12.06 5 11.88 6 10.98 10 10.98 2 10.08 7 9.18 3 9.00 8 7.02 (LC3.24) We looked at the distribution of the numerical variable temp split by the numerical variable month that we converted to a categorical variable using the factor() function. Why would a boxplot of temp split by the numerical variable pressure similarly converted to a categorical variable using the factor() not be informative? Solution: Because there are 12 unique values of month yielding only 12 boxes in our boxplot. There are many more unique values of pressure (469 unique values in fact), because values are to the first decimal place. This would lead to 469 boxes, which is too many for people to digest. (LC3.25) Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers. Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram? Solution: In a histogram, the bin corresponding to where an outlier lies may not by high enough for us to see. In a boxplot, they are explicitly labelled separately. (LC3.26) Why are histograms inappropriate for visualizing categorical variables? Solution: Histograms are for numerical variables i.e. the horizontal part of each histogram bar represents an interval, whereas for a categorical variable each bar represents only one level of the categorical variable. (LC3.27) What is the difference between histograms and barplots? Solution: See above. (LC3.28) How many Envoy Air flights departed NYC in 2013? Solution: Envoy Air is carrier code MQ and thus 26397 flights departed NYC in 2013. (LC3.29) What was the seventh highest airline in terms of departed flights from NYC in 2013? How could we better present the table to get this answer quickly? Solution: What a pain! We’ll see in Chapter 5 on Data Wrangling that applying arrange(desc(n)) will sort this table in descending order of n! (LC3.30) Why should pie charts be avoided and replaced by barplots? Solution: In our opinion, comparisons using horizontal lines are easier than comparing angles and areas of circles. (LC3.31) What is your opinion as to why pie charts continue to be used? Solution: Legacy? (LC3.32) What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure? Solution: Because the red, green, and blue bars don’t all start at 0 (only red does), it makes comparing counts hard. (LC3.33) What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights? Solution: The different airlines prefer different airports. For example, United is mostly a Newark carrier and JetBlue is a JFK carrier. If airlines didn’t prefer airports, each color would be roughly one third of each bar.} (LC3.34) Why might the side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case? Solution: We can easily compare the different aiports for a given carrier using a single comparison line i.e. things are lined up (LC3.35) What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot, in general? Solution: It is hard to get totals for each airline. (LC3.36) Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case? Solution: Not that different than using side-by-side; depends on how you want to organize your presentation. (LC3.37) What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot? Solution: Now we can also compare the different carriers within a particular airport easily too. For example, we can read off who the top carrier for each airport is easily using a single horizontal line. D.3 Chapter 4 Solutions library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(nycflights13) (LC4.1) What’s another way using the “not” operator ! to filter only the rows that are not going to Burlington, VT nor Seattle, WA in the flights data frame? Test this out using the code above. Solution: # Original in book not_BTV_SEA &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(!(dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;)) # Alternative way not_BTV_SEA &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(!dest == &quot;BTV&quot; &amp; !dest == &quot;SEA&quot;) # Yet another way not_BTV_SEA &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(dest != &quot;BTV&quot; &amp; dest != &quot;SEA&quot;) (LC4.2) Say a doctor is studying the effect of smoking on lung cancer for a large number of patients who have records measured at five year intervals. She notices that a large number of patients have missing data points because the patient has died, so she chooses to ignore these patients in her analysis. What is wrong with this doctor’s approach? Solution: The missing patients may have died of lung cancer! So to ignore them might seriously bias your results! It is very important to think of what the consequences on your analysis are of ignoring missing data! Ask yourself: There is a systematic reasons why certain values are missing? If so, you might be biasing your results! If there isn’t, then it might be ok to “sweep missing values under the rug.” (LC4.3) Modify the above summarize function to create summary_temp to also use the n() summary function: summarize(count = n()). What does the returned value correspond to? Solution: It corresponds to a count of the number of observations/rows: weather %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) # A tibble: 1 x 1 count &lt;int&gt; 1 26115 (LC4.4) Why doesn’t the following code work? Run the code line by line instead of all at once, and then look at the data. In other words, run summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) first. summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% summarize(std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) Solution: Consider the output of only running the first two lines: weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 mean &lt;dbl&gt; 1 55.3 Because after the first summarize(), the variable temp disappears as it has been collapsed to the value mean. So when we try to run the second summarize(), it can’t find the variable temp to compute the standard deviation of. (LC4.5) Recall from Chapter 3 when we looked at plots of temperatures by months in NYC. What does the standard deviation column in the summary_monthly_temp data frame tell us about temperatures in New York City throughout the year? Solution: The standard deviation is a quantification of spread and variability. We see that the period in November, December, and January has the most variation in weather, so you can expect very different temperatures on different days. (LC4.6) What code would be required to get the mean and standard deviation temperature for each day in 2013 for NYC? Solution: Note: group_by(day) is not enough, because day is a value between 1-31. We need to group_by(year, month, day) library(dplyr) library(nycflights13) summary_temp_by_month &lt;- weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize( mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE) ) (LC4.7) Recreate by_monthly_origin, but instead of grouping via group_by(origin, month), group variables in a different order group_by(month, origin). What differs in the resulting dataset? Solution: by_monthly_origin In by_monthly_origin the month column is now first and the rows are sorted by month instead of origin. If you compare the values of count in by_origin_monthly and by_monthly_origin using the View() function, you’ll see that the values are actually the same, just presented in a different order. (LC4.8) How could we identify how many flights left each of the three airports for each carrier? Solution: We could summarize the count from each airport using the n() function, which counts rows. All remarkably similar! Note: the n() function counts rows, whereas the sum(VARIABLE_NAME) funciton sums all values of a certain numerical variable VARIABLE_NAME. (LC4.9) How does the filter operation differ from a group_by followed by a summarize? Solution: filter picks out rows from the original dataset without modifying them, whereas group_by %&gt;% summarize computes summaries of numerical variables, and hence reports new values. (LC4.10) What do positive values of the gain variable in flights correspond to? What about negative values? And what about a zero value? Solution: Say a flight departed 20 minutes late, i.e. dep_delay = 20 Then arrived 10 minutes late, i.e. arr_delay = 10. Then gain = dep_delay - arr_delay = 20 - 10 = 10 is positive, so it “made up/gained time in the air.” 0 means the departure and arrival time were the same, so no time was made up in the air. We see in most cases that the gain is near 0 minutes. I never understood this. If the pilot says “we’re going make up time in the air” because of delay by flying faster, why don’t you always just fly faster to begin with? (LC4.11) Could we create the dep_delay and arr_delay columns by simply subtracting dep_time from sched_dep_time and similarly for arrivals? Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in flights. Solution: No because you can’t do direct arithmetic on times. The difference in time between 12:03 and 11:59 is 4 minutes, but 1203-1159 = 44 (LC4.12) What can we say about the distribution of gain? Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the gain_summary data frame values. Solution: Most of the time the gain is a little under zero, most of the time the gain is between -50 and 50 minutes. There are some extreme cases however! (LC4.13) Looking at Figure 4.7, when joining flights and weather (or, in other words, matching the hourly weather values with each flight), why do we need to join by all of year, month, day, hour, and origin, and not just hour? Solution: Because hour is simply a value between 0 and 23; to identify a specific hour, we need to know which year, month, day and at which airport. (LC4.14) What surprises you about the top 10 destinations from NYC in 2013? Solution: This question is subjective! What surprises me is the high number of flights to Boston. Wouldn’t it be easier and quicker to take the train? (LC4.15) What are some advantages of data in normal forms? What are some disadvantages? Solution: When datasets are in normal form, we can easily _join them with other datasets! For example, we can join the flights data with the planes data. (LC4.16) What are some ways to select all three of the dest, air_time, and distance variables from flights? Give the code showing how to do this in at least three different ways. Solution: (LC4.17) How could one use starts_with, ends_with, and contains to select columns from the flights data frame? Provide three different examples in total: one for starts_with, one for ends_with, and one for contains. Solution: (LC4.18) Why might we want to use the select() function on a data frame? Solution: To narrow down the data frame, to make it easier to look at. Using View() for example. (LC4.19) Create a new data frame that shows the top 5 airports with the largest arrival delays from NYC in 2013. Solution: (LC4.20) Using the datasets included in the nycflights13 package, compute the available seat miles for each airline sorted in descending order. After completing all the necessary data wrangling steps, the resulting data frame should have 16 rows (one for each airline) and 2 columns (airline name and available seat miles). Here are some hints: Crucial: Unless you are very confident in what you are doing, it is worthwhile to not starting coding right away, but rather first sketch out on paper all the necessary data wrangling steps not using exact code, but rather high-level pseudocode that is informal yet detailed enough to articulate what you are doing. This way you won’t confuse what you are trying to do (the algorithm) with how you are going to do it (writing dplyr code). Take a close look at all the datasets using the View() function: flights, weather, planes, airports, and airlines to identify which variables are necessary to compute available seat miles. Figure 4.7 above showing how the various datasets can be joined will also be useful. Consider the data wrangling verbs in Table 4.1 as your toolbox! Solution: Here are some examples of student-written pseudocode. Based on our own pseudocode, let’s first display the entire solution. Let’s now break this down step-by-step. To compute the available seat miles for a given flight, we need the distance variable from the flights data frame and the seats variable from the planes data frame, necessitating a join by the key variable tailnum as illustrated in Figure 4.7. To keep the resulting data frame easy to view, we’ll select() only these two variables and carrier: Now for each flight we can compute the available seat miles ASM by multiplying the number of seats by the distance via a mutate(): Next we want to sum the ASM for each carrier. We achieve this by first grouping by carrier and then summarizing using the sum() function: However, because for certain carriers certain flights have missing NA values, the resulting table also returns NA’s. We can eliminate these by adding a na.rm = TRUE argument to sum(), telling R that we want to remove the NA’s in the sum. We saw this in Section 4.3: Finally, we arrange() the data in desc()ending order of ASM. While the above data frame is correct, the IATA carrier code is not always useful. For example, what carrier is WN? We can address this by joining with the airlines dataset using carrier is the key variable. While this step is not absolutely required, it goes a long way to making the table easier to make sense of. It is important to be empathetic with the ultimate consumers of your presented data! D.4 Chapter 5 Solutions library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(nycflights13) library(tidyr) library(readr) (LC5.1) What are common characteristics of “tidy” datasets? Solution: Rows correspond to observations, while columns correspond to variables. (LC5.2) What makes “tidy” datasets useful for organizing data? Solution: Tidy datasets are an organized way of viewing data. This format is required for the ggplot2 and dplyr packages for data visualization and wrangling. (LC5.3) Take a look the airline_safety data frame included in the fivethirtyeight data. Run the following: airline_safety After reading the help file by running ?airline_safety, we see that airline_safety is a data frame containing information on different airlines companies’ safety records. This data was originally reported on the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com in Nate Silver’s article “Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?”. Let’s ignore the incl_reg_subsidiaries and avail_seat_km_per_week variables for simplicity: airline_safety_smaller &lt;- airline_safety %&gt;% select(-c(incl_reg_subsidiaries, avail_seat_km_per_week)) airline_safety_smaller # A tibble: 56 x 7 airline incidents_85_99 fatal_accidents… fatalities_85_99 incidents_00_14 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 Aer Li… 2 0 0 0 2 Aerofl… 76 14 128 6 3 Aeroli… 6 0 0 1 4 Aerome… 3 1 64 5 5 Air Ca… 2 0 0 2 6 Air Fr… 14 4 79 6 7 Air In… 2 1 329 4 8 Air Ne… 3 0 0 5 9 Alaska… 5 0 0 5 10 Alital… 7 2 50 4 # … with 46 more rows, and 2 more variables: fatal_accidents_00_14 &lt;int&gt;, # fatalities_00_14 &lt;int&gt; This data frame is not in “tidy” format. How would you convert this data frame to be in “tidy” format, in particular so that it has a variable incident_type_years indicating the indicent type/year and a variable count of the counts? Solution: Using the gather() function from the tidyr package: airline_safety_smaller_tidy &lt;- airline_safety_smaller %&gt;% gather(key = incident_type_years, value = count, -airline) airline_safety_smaller_tidy # A tibble: 336 x 3 airline incident_type_years count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 Aer Lingus incidents_85_99 2 2 Aeroflot incidents_85_99 76 3 Aerolineas Argentinas incidents_85_99 6 4 Aeromexico incidents_85_99 3 5 Air Canada incidents_85_99 2 6 Air France incidents_85_99 14 7 Air India incidents_85_99 2 8 Air New Zealand incidents_85_99 3 9 Alaska Airlines incidents_85_99 5 10 Alitalia incidents_85_99 7 # … with 326 more rows If you look at the resulting airline_safety_smaller_tidy data frame in the spreadsheet viewer, you’ll see that the variable incident_type_years has 6 possible values: &quot;incidents_85_99&quot;, &quot;fatal_accidents_85_99&quot;, &quot;fatalities_85_99&quot;, &quot;incidents_00_14&quot;, &quot;fatal_accidents_00_14&quot;, &quot;fatalities_00_14&quot; corresponding to the 6 columns of airline_safety_smaller we tidied. (LC5.4) Convert the dem_score data frame into a tidy data frame and assign the name of dem_score_tidy to the resulting long-formatted data frame. Solution: Running the following in the console: Let’s now compare the dem_score and dem_score_tidy. dem_score has democracy score information for each year in columns, whereas in dem_score_tidy there are explicit variables year and democracy_score. While both representations of the data contain the same information, we can only use ggplot() to create plots using the dem_score_tidy data frame. (LC5.5) Read in the life expectancy data stored at https://moderndive.com/data/le_mess.csv and convert it to a tidy data frame. Solution: The code is similar We observe the same construct structure with respect to year in life_expectancy vs life_expectancy_tidy as we did in dem_score vs dem_score_tidy: D.5 Chapter 6 Solutions To come! library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(gapminder) library(skimr) "],
