"],["foreword.html", "Foreword", " Foreword These are exciting times in statistics and data science education. (I am predicting this statement will continue to be true regardless of whether you are reading this foreword in 2020 or 2050.) But (isn’t there always a but?), as a statistics educator, it can also feel a bit overwhelming to stay on top of all the new statistical, technological, and pedagogical innovations. I find myself constantly asking, “Am I teaching my students the correct content, with the relevant software, and in the most effective way?” Before I make all of us feel lost at sea, let me point out how great a life raft I have found in ModernDive. In a sea of intro stats textbooks, ModernDive floats to the top of my list, and let me tell you why. (Note my use of ModernDive here refers to the book in its shortened title version. This also matches up nicely with the neat hex sticker Drs. Ismay and Kim created for the cover of ModernDive, too.) My favorite aspect of ModernDive, if I must pick a favorite, is that students gain experience with the whole data analysis pipeline (see Figure 0.2). In particular, ModernDive is one of the few intro stats textbooks that teaches students how to wrangle data. And, while data cleaning may not be as groovy as model building, it’s often a prerequisite step! The world is full of messy data and ModernDive equips students to transform their data via the dplyr package. Speaking of dplyr, students of ModernDive are exposed to the tidyverse suite of R packages. Designed with a common structure, tidyverse functions are written to be easy to learn and use. And, since most intro stats students are programming newbies, ModernDive carefully walks the students through each new function it presents and provides frequent reinforcement through the many Learning checks dispersed throughout the chapters. Overall, ModernDive includes wise choices for the placement of topics. Starting with data visualization, ModernDive gets students building ggplot2 graphs early on and then continues to reinforce important concepts graphically throughout the book. After moving through data wrangling and data importing, modeling plays a prominent role, with two chapters devoted to building regression models and a later chapter on inference for regression. Lastly, statistical inference is presented through a computational lens with calculations done via the infer package. I first met Drs. Ismay and Kim while attending their workshop at the 2017 US Conference on Teaching Statistics. They pushed us as participants to put data first and to use computers, instead of math, as the engine for statistical inference. That experience helped me modernize my own intro stats course and introduced me to two really forward-thinking statistics and data science educators. It has been exciting to see ModernDive develop and grow into such a wonderful, timely textbook. I hope you have decided to dive on in! Kelly S. McConville, Harvard University "],["preface.html", "Preface Introduction for students Introduction for instructors Connect and contribute Acknowledgements About this book", " Preface       Help! I’m completely new to coding and I need to learn R and RStudio! What do I do? If you’re asking yourself this question, then you’ve come to the right place! Start with the “Introduction for students” section. Are you an instructor hoping to use this book in your courses? We recommend reading the “Introduction for students” section first. Then, read the “Introduction for instructors” section for more information on how to teach with this book. Are you looking to connect with and contribute to ModernDive? Then, read the “Connect and contribute” section for information on how. Are you curious about the publishing of this book? Then, read the “About this book” section for more information on the open-source technology, in particular R Markdown and the bookdown package. This is version 2.0.0 of ModernDive published on June 30, 2024. For previous versions of ModernDive, see the “About this book” section below. Introduction for students This book assumes no prerequisites: no algebra, no calculus, and no prior programming/coding experience. This is intended to be a gentle introduction to the practice of analyzing data and answering questions using data the way data scientists, statisticians, data journalists, and other researchers would. We present a map of your upcoming journey in Figure 0.1. FIGURE 0.1: ModernDive flowchart. You’ll first get started with data in Chapter 1 where you’ll learn about the difference between R and RStudio, start coding in R, install and load your first R packages, and explore your first dataset: all domestic departure flights from a New York City airport in 2023. Then you’ll cover the following three portions of this book (Parts 2 and 4 are combined into a single portion): Data science with tidyverse. You’ll assemble your data science toolbox using tidyverse packages. In particular, you’ll Ch.2: Visualize data using the ggplot2 package. Ch.3: Wrangle data using the dplyr package. Ch.4: Learn about the concept of “tidy” data as a standardized data input and output format for all packages in the tidyverse. Furthermore, you’ll learn how to import spreadsheet files into R using the readr package. Statistical/Data modeling with moderndive. Using these data science tools and helper functions from the moderndive package, you’ll fit your first data models. In particular, you’ll Ch.5: Discover basic regression models with only one explanatory variable. Ch.6: Examine multiple regression models with more than one explanatory variable. Statistical inference with infer. Once again using your newly acquired data science tools, you’ll unpack statistical inference using the infer package. In particular, you’ll: Ch.7: Learn about the role that sampling variability plays in statistical inference and the role that sample size plays in this sampling variability. Ch.8: Construct confidence intervals using bootstrapping. Ch.9: Conduct hypothesis tests using permutation. Statistical/Data modeling with moderndive (revisited): Armed with your understanding of statistical inference, you’ll revisit and review the models you’ve constructed in Ch.5 and Ch.6. In particular, you’ll: Ch.10: Interpret confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in a regression setting. We’ll end with a discussion on what it means to “tell your story with data” in Chapter 11 by presenting example case studies.1 What we hope you will learn from this book We hope that by the end of this book, you’ll have learned how to: Use R and the tidyverse suite of R packages for data science. Fit your first models to data, using a method known as linear regression. Perform statistical inference using sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. Tell your story with data using these tools. What do we mean by data stories? We mean any analysis involving data that engages the reader in answering questions with careful visuals and thoughtful discussion. Further discussions on data stories can be found in the blog post “Tell a Meaningful Story With Data.” Over the course of this book, you will develop your “data science toolbox,” equipping yourself with tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and statistical/data modeling using regression. In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization. In today’s world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas. We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are used to convey relationships within data. In general, we’ll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book. To impart the statistical lessons of this book, we have intentionally minimized the number of mathematical formulas used. Instead, you’ll develop a conceptual understanding of statistics using data visualization and computer simulations. We hope this is a more intuitive experience than the way statistics has traditionally been taught in the past and how it is commonly perceived. Finally, you’ll learn the importance of literate programming. By this we mean you’ll learn how to write code that is useful not just for a computer to execute, but also for readers to understand exactly what your analysis is doing and how you did it. This is part of a greater effort to encourage reproducible research (see the “Reproducible research” subsection in this Preface for more details). Hal Abelson coined the phrase that we will follow throughout this book: Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. We understand that there may be challenging moments as you learn to program. Both of us continue to struggle and find ourselves often using web searches to find answers and reach out to colleagues for help. In the long run though, we all can solve problems faster and more elegantly via programming. We wrote this book as our way to help you get started and you should know that there is a huge community of R users that are happy to help everyone along as well. This community exists in particular on the internet on various forums and websites such as stackoverflow.com. Data/science pipeline You may think of statistics as just being a bunch of numbers. We commonly hear the phrase “statistician” when listening to broadcasts of sporting events. Statistics (in particular, data analysis), in addition to describing numbers like with baseball batting averages, plays a vital role in all of the sciences. You’ll commonly hear the phrase “statistically significant” thrown around in the media. You’ll see articles that say, “Science now shows that chocolate is good for you.” Underpinning these claims is data analysis. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to better understand whether these claims should be trusted or whether we should be wary. Inside data analysis are many sub-fields that we will discuss throughout this book (though not necessarily in this order): data collection data wrangling data visualization statistical modeling inference correlation and regression interpretation of results data communication/storytelling These sub-fields are summarized in what Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham have previously termed the “data/science pipeline” in Figure 0.2. FIGURE 0.2: Data/science pipeline. We will begin by digging into the grey Understand portion of the cycle with data visualization, then with a discussion on what is meant by tidy data and data wrangling, and then conclude by talking about interpreting and discussing the results of our models via Communication. These steps are vital to any statistical analysis. But, why should you care about statistics? There’s a reason that many fields require a statistics course. Scientific knowledge grows through an understanding of statistical significance and data analysis. You needn’t be intimidated by statistics. It’s not the beast that it used to be and, paired with computation, you’ll see how reproducible research in the sciences particularly increases scientific knowledge. Reproducible research The most important tool is the mindset, when starting, that the end product will be reproducible. – Keith Baggerly Another goal of this book is to help readers understand the importance of reproducible analyses. The hope is to get readers into the habit of making their analyses reproducible from the very beginning. This means we’ll be trying to help you build new habits. This will take practice and be difficult at times. You’ll see just why it is so important for you to keep track of your code and document it well to help yourself later and any potential collaborators as well. Copying and pasting results from one program into a word processor is not an ideal way to conduct efficient and effective scientific research. It’s much more important for time to be spent on data collection and data analysis and not on copying and pasting plots back and forth across a variety of programs. In traditional analyses, if an error was made with the original data, we’d need to step through the entire process again: recreate the plots and copy-and-paste all of the new plots and our statistical analysis into our document. This is error prone and a frustrating use of time. We want to help you to get away from this tedious activity so that we can spend more time doing science. We are talking about computational reproducibility. – Yihui Xie Reproducibility means a lot of things in terms of different scientific fields. Are experiments conducted in a way that another researcher could follow the steps and get similar results? In this book, we will focus on what is known as computational reproducibility. This refers to being able to pass all of one’s data analysis, datasets, and conclusions to someone else and have them get exactly the same results on their machine. This allows for time to be spent interpreting results and considering assumptions instead of the more error prone way of starting from scratch or following a list of steps that may be different from machine to machine. Final note for students At this point, if you are interested in instructor perspectives on this book, ways to contribute and collaborate, or the technical details of this book’s construction and publishing, then continue with the rest of the chapter. Otherwise, let’s get started with R and RStudio in Chapter 1! Introduction for instructors Resources Here are some resources to help you use ModernDive: We’ve included review questions posed as Learning checks. You can find all the solutions to all Learning checks in Appendix D of the online version of the book at https://moderndive.com/D-appendixD.html. Dr. Jenny Smetzer and Albert Y. Kim have written a series of labs and problem sets. You can find them at https://moderndive.com/labs. You can see the webpages for two courses that use ModernDive: Smith College “SDS192 Introduction to Data Science”: https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS192/. Smith College “SDS220 Introduction to Probability and Statistics”: https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS220/. Why did we write this book? This book is inspired by Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R (Chihara and Hesterberg 2011) OpenIntro: Intro Stat with Randomization and Simulation (Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014) R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2017) The first book, designed for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, provides an excellent resource on how to use resampling to impart statistical concepts like sampling distributions using computation instead of large-sample approximations and other mathematical formulas. The last two books are free options for learning about introductory statistics and data science, providing an alternative to the many traditionally expensive introductory statistics textbooks. When looking over the introductory statistics textbooks that currently exist, we found there wasn’t one that incorporated many newly developed R packages directly into the text, in particular the many packages included in the tidyverse set of packages, such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and readr that will be the focus of this book’s first part on “Data Science with tidyverse.” Additionally, there wasn’t an open-source and easily reproducible textbook available that exposed new learners to all four of the learning goals we listed in the “Introduction for students” subsection. We wanted to write a book that could develop theory via computational techniques and help novices master the R language in doing so. Who is this book for? This book is intended for instructors of traditional introductory statistics classes using RStudio, who would like to inject more data science topics into their syllabus. RStudio can be used in either the server version or the desktop version. (This is discussed further in Subsection 1.1.1.) We assume that students taking the class will have no prior algebra, no calculus, nor programming/coding experience. Here are some principles and beliefs we kept in mind while writing this text. If you agree with them, this is the book for you. Blur the lines between lecture and lab With increased availability and accessibility of laptops and open-source non-proprietary statistical software, the strict dichotomy between lab and lecture can be loosened. It’s much harder for students to understand the importance of using software if they only use it once a week or less. They forget the syntax in much the same way someone learning a foreign language forgets the grammar rules. Frequent reinforcement is key. Focus on the entire data/science research pipeline We believe that the entirety of Grolemund and Wickham’s data/science pipeline as seen in Figure 0.2 should be taught. We heed George Cobb’s call to “minimize prerequisites to research”: students should be answering questions with data as soon as possible. It’s all about the data We leverage R packages for rich, real, and realistic datasets that at the same time are easy-to-load into R, such as the nycflights23 and fivethirtyeight packages. We believe that data visualization is a “gateway drug” for statistics and that the grammar of graphics as implemented in the ggplot2 package is the best way to impart such lessons. However, we often hear: “You can’t teach ggplot2 for data visualization in intro stats!” We, like David Robinson, are much more optimistic and have found our students have been largely successful in learning it. dplyr has made data wrangling much more accessible to novices, and hence much more interesting datasets can be explored. Use simulation/resampling to introduce statistical inference, not probability/mathematical formulas Instead of using formulas, large-sample approximations, and probability tables, we teach statistical concepts using simulation-based inference. This allows for a de-emphasis of traditional probability topics, freeing up room in the syllabus for other topics. Bridges to these mathematical concepts are given as well to help with relation of these traditional topics with more modern approaches. Don’t fence off students from the computation pool, throw them in! Computing skills are essential to working with data in the 21st century. Given this fact, we feel that to shield students from computing is to ultimately do them a disservice. We are not teaching a course on coding/programming per se, but rather just enough of the computational and algorithmic thinking necessary for data analysis. Complete reproducibility and customizability We are frustrated when textbooks give examples, but not the source code and the data itself. We give you the source code for all examples as well as the whole book! While we have made choices to occasionally hide the code that produces more complicated figures, reviewing the book’s GitHub repository will provide you with all the code (see below). Ultimately the best textbook is one you’ve written yourself. You know best your audience, their background, and their priorities. You know best your own style and the types of examples and problems you like best. Customization is the ultimate end. We encourage you to take what we’ve provided and make it work for your own needs.

"],["1-getting-started.html", "Chapter 1 Getting Started with Data in R 1.1 What are R and RStudio? 1.2 How do I code in R? 1.3 What are R packages? 1.4 Explore your first datasets 1.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 1 Getting Started with Data in R Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first: What are R and RStudio? How do I code in R? What are R packages? We’ll introduce these concepts in the upcoming Sections 1.1-1.3. If you are already somewhat familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to Section 1.4 where we’ll introduce our first dataset: all domestic flights departing one of the three main New York City (NYC) airports in 2023. This is a dataset we will explore in depth for much of the rest of this book. 1.1 What are R and RStudio? Throughout this book, we will assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest, R is like a car’s engine while RStudio is like a car’s dashboard as illustrated in Figure 1.1. FIGURE 1.1: Analogy of difference between R and RStudio. More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well. 1.1.1 Installing R and RStudio Note about RStudio Server or RStudio Cloud: If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server or RStudio Cloud, then you can skip this section. We do recommend after a few months of working on RStudio Server/Cloud that you return to these instructions to install this software on your own computer though. You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. It is important that you install R first and then install RStudio. You must do this first: Download and install R by going to https://cloud.r-project.org/. If you are a Windows user: Click on “Download R for Windows”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link. If you are macOS user: Click on “Download R for macOS”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of May 24, 2024 was R-4.4.0. If you are a Linux user: Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup. You must do this second: Download and install RStudio at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to “Installers for Supported Platforms” near the bottom of the page. Click on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system. 1.1.2 Using R via RStudio Recall our car analogy from earlier. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs (also called applications) you can open. We’ll always work in RStudio and not in the R application. Figure 1.2 shows what icon you should be clicking on your computer. FIGURE 1.2: Icons of R versus RStudio on your computer. After you open RStudio, you should see something similar to Figure 1.3. (Note that slight differences might exist if the RStudio interface is updated to not be this by default.) FIGURE 1.3: RStudio interface to R. Note the three panes which are three panels dividing the screen: the console pane, the files pane, and the environment pane. Over the course of this chapter, you’ll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serves. 1.2 How do I code in R? Now that you’re set up with R and RStudio, you are probably asking yourself, “OK. Now how do I use R?”. The first thing to note is that unlike other statistical software programs like Excel, SPSS, or Minitab that provide point-and-click interfaces, R is an interpreted language. This means you have to type in commands written in R code. In other words, you have to code/program in R. Note that we’ll use the terms “coding” and “programming” interchangeably in this book. While it is not required to be a seasoned coder/computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that new R users need to understand. Consequently, while this book is not a book on programming, you will still learn just enough of these basic programming concepts needed to explore and analyze data effectively. 1.2.1 Basic programming concepts and terminology We now introduce some basic programming concepts and terminology. Instead of asking you to memorize all these concepts and terminology right now, we’ll guide you so that you’ll “learn by doing.” To help you learn, we will always use a different font to distinguish regular text from computer_code. The best way to master these topics is, in our opinions, through deliberate practice with R and lots of repetition. Basics: Console pane: where you enter in commands. Running code: the act of telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the console. Objects: where values are saved in R. We’ll show you how to assign values to objects and how to display the contents of objects. Data types: integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, and characters. Integers are values like -1, 0, 2, 4092. Doubles or numerics are a larger set of values containing both the integers but also fractions and decimal values like -24.932 and 0.8. Logicals are either TRUE or FALSE while characters are text such as “cabbage”, “Hamilton”, “The Wire is the greatest TV show ever”, and “This ramen is delicious.” Note that characters are often denoted with the quotation marks around them. Vectors: a series of values. These are created using the c() function, where c() stands for “combine” or “concatenate.” For example, c(6, 11, 13, 31, 90, 92) creates a six element series of positive integer values . Factors: categorical data are commonly represented in R as factors. Categorical data can also be represented as strings. We’ll study this difference as we progress through the book. Data frames: rectangular spreadsheets. They are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations. We’ll cover data frames later in Section 1.4. Conditionals: Testing for equality in R using == (and not =, which is typically used for assignment). For example, 2 + 1 == 3 compares 2 + 1 to 3 and is correct R code, while 2 + 1 = 3 will return an error. Boolean algebra: TRUE/FALSE statements and mathematical operators such as &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), and != (not equal to). For example, 4 + 2 &gt;= 3 will return TRUE, but 3 + 5 &lt;= 1 will return FALSE. Logical operators: &amp; representing “and” as well as | representing “or.” For example, (2 + 1 == 3) &amp; (2 + 1 == 4) returns FALSE since both clauses are not TRUE (only the first clause is TRUE). On the other hand, (2 + 1 == 3) | (2 + 1 == 4) returns TRUE since at least one of the two clauses is TRUE. Functions, also called commands: Functions perform tasks in R. They take in inputs called arguments and return outputs. You can either manually specify a function’s arguments or use the function’s default values. For example, the function seq() in R generates a sequence of numbers. If you just run seq() it will return the value 1. That doesn’t seem very useful! This is because the default arguments are set as seq(from = 1, to = 1). Thus, if you don’t pass in different values for from and to to change this behavior, R just assumes all you want is the number 1. You can change the argument values by updating the values after the = sign. If we try out seq(from = 2, to = 5) we get the result 2 3 4 5 that we might expect. We’ll work with functions a lot throughout this book and you’ll get lots of practice in understanding their behaviors. To further assist you in understanding when a function is mentioned in the book, we’ll also include the () after them as we did with seq() above. This list is by no means an exhaustive list of all the programming concepts and terminology needed to become a savvy R user; such a list would be so large it wouldn’t be very useful, especially for novices. Rather, we feel this is a minimally viable list of programming concepts and terminology you need to know before getting started. We feel that you can learn the rest as you go. Remember that your mastery of all of these concepts and terminology will build as you practice more and more. 1.2.2 Errors, warnings, and messages One thing that intimidates new R and RStudio users is how it reports errors, warnings, and messages. R reports errors, warnings, and messages in a glaring red font, which makes it seem like it is scolding you. However, seeing red text in the console is not always bad. R will show red text in the console pane in three different situations: Errors: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and will try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. For example, we’ll see in Subsection 1.3.3 if you see Error in ggplot(...) : could not find function \"ggplot\", it means that the ggplot() function is not accessible because the package that contains the function (ggplot2) was not loaded with library(ggplot2). Thus you cannot use the ggplot() function without the ggplot2 package being loaded first. Warnings: When the red text is a warning, it will be prefaced with “Warning:” and R will try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. For example, you will see in Chapter 2 if you create a scatterplot based on a dataset where two of the rows of data have missing entries that would be needed to create points in the scatterplot, you will see this warning: Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point). R will still produce the scatterplot with all the remaining non-missing values, but it is warning you that two of the points aren’t there. Messages: When the red text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning”, it’s just a friendly message. You’ll see these messages when you load R packages in the upcoming Subsection 1.3.2 or when you read data saved in spreadsheet files with the read_csv() function as you’ll see in Chapter 4. These are helpful diagnostic messages and they don’t stop your code from working. Additionally, you’ll see these messages when you install packages too using install.packages() as discussed in Subsection 1.3.1. Remember, when you see red text in the console, don’t panic. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Rather: If the text starts with “Error”, figure out what’s causing it. Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong! If the text starts with “Warning”, figure out if it’s something to worry about. For instance, if you get a warning about missing values in a scatterplot and you know there are missing values, you’re fine. If that’s surprising, look at your data and see what’s missing. Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working fine, but watch out/pay attention. Otherwise, the text is just a message. Read it, wave back at R, and thank it for talking to you. Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine and keep on going! 1.2.3 Tips on learning to code Learning to code/program is quite similar to learning a foreign language. It can be daunting and frustrating at first. Such frustrations are common and it is normal to feel discouraged as you learn. However, just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn and improve. Here are a few useful tips to keep in mind as you learn to program: Remember that computers are not actually that smart: You may think your computer or smartphone is “smart,” but really people spent a lot of time and energy designing them to appear “smart.” In reality, you have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore, the instructions you give your computer can’t have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way. Take the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach: Especially when you learn your first programming language or you need to understand particularly complicated code, it is often much easier to take existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends. This is as opposed to trying to type out the code from scratch. We call this the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach. So early on, we suggest not trying to write code from memory, but rather take existing examples we have provided you, then copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. After you start feeling more confident, you can slowly move away from this approach and write code from scratch. Think of the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach as training wheels for a child learning to ride a bike. After getting comfortable, they won’t need them anymore. The best way to learn to code is by doing: Rather than learning to code for its own sake, we find that learning to code goes much smoother when you have a goal in mind or when you are working on a particular project, like analyzing data that you are interested in and that is important to you. Practice is key: Just as the only method to improve your foreign language skills is through lots of practice and speaking, the only method to improving your coding skills is through lots of practice. Don’t worry, however, we’ll give you plenty of opportunities to do so! 1.3 What are R packages? Another point of confusion with many new R users is the idea of an R package. R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet. For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are the ggplot2 package (Wickham et al. 2024) for data visualization in Chapter 2, the dplyr package (Wickham et al. 2023) for data wrangling in Chapter 3, the moderndive package (Kim and Ismay 2024) that accompanies this book, and the infer package (Bray et al. 2024) for “tidy” and transparent statistical inference in Chapters 8, 9, and 10. A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone: FIGURE 1.4: Analogy of R versus R packages. So R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play. Let’s continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a photo you have just taken with friends on Instagram. You need to: Install the app: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you’re set for the time being. You might need to do this again in the future when there is an update to the app. Open the app: After you’ve installed Instagram, you need to open it. Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to: Install the package: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you’ve installed a package, you likely won’t install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version. “Load” the package: “Loading” a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not “loaded” by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to “load” each package you want to use every time you start RStudio. Let’s perform these two steps for the ggplot2 package for data visualization. 1.3.1 Package installation Note about RStudio Server or RStudio Cloud: If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server or RStudio Cloud, you might not need to install packages, as they might be preinstalled for you by your instructor. That being said, it is still a good idea to know this process for later on when you are not using RStudio Server or Cloud, but rather RStudio Desktop on your own computer. There are two ways to install an R package: an easy way and a more advanced way. Let’s install the ggplot2 package the easy way first as shown in Figure 1.5. In the Files pane of RStudio: Click on the “Packages” tab. Click on “Install” next to Update. Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type ggplot2. Click “Install.” FIGURE 1.5: Installing packages in R the easy way. An alternative but slightly less convenient way to install a package is by typing install.packages(\"ggplot2\") in the console pane of RStudio and pressing Return/Enter on your keyboard. Note you must include the quotation marks around the name of the package. Much like an app on your phone, you only have to install a package once. However, if you want to update a previously installed package to a newer version, you need to reinstall it by repeating the earlier steps. Learning check (LC1.1) Repeat the earlier installation steps, but for the dplyr, nycflights23, and knitr packages. This will install the earlier mentioned dplyr package for data wrangling, the nycflights23 package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a NYC airport in 2023, and the knitr package for generating easy-to-read tables in R. We’ll use these packages in the next section. Note that if you’d like your output on your computer to match up exactly with the output presented throughout the book, you may want to use the exact versions of the packages that we used. You can find a full listing of these packages and their versions in Appendix D. This likely won’t be relevant for novices, but we included it for reproducibility reasons. 1.3.2 Package loading Recall that after you’ve installed a package, you need to “load it.” In other words, you need to “open it.” We do this by using the library() command. For example, to load the ggplot2 package, run the following code in the console pane. What do we mean by “run the following code”? Either type or copy-and-paste the following code into the console pane and then hit the Enter key. library(ggplot2) If after running the earlier code, a blinking cursor returns next to the &gt; “prompt” sign, it means you were successful and the ggplot2 package is now loaded and ready to use. If, however, you get a red “error message” that reads ... Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’ ... it means that you didn’t successfully install it. This is an example of an “error message” we discussed in Subsection 1.2.2. If you get this error message, go back to Subsection 1.3.1 on R package installation and make sure to install the ggplot2 package before proceeding. Learning check (LC1.2) “Load” the dplyr, nycflights23, and knitr packages as well by repeating the earlier steps. 1.3.3 Package use One very common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is they forget to “load” them first by using the library() command we just saw. Remember: you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio. If you don’t first “load” a package, but attempt to use one of its features, you’ll see an error message similar to: Error: could not find function This is a different error message than the one you just saw on a package not having been installed yet. R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been “loaded.” R doesn’t know where to find the function you are using. Almost all new users forget to do this when starting out, and it is a little annoying to get used to doing it. However, you’ll remember with practice and after some time it will become second nature for you. 1.4 Explore your first datasets Let’s put everything we’ve learned so far into practice and start exploring some real data! Data comes to us in a variety of formats, from pictures to text to numbers. Throughout this book, we’ll focus on datasets that are saved in “spreadsheet”-type format. This is probably the most common way data are collected and saved in many fields. Remember from Subsection 1.2.1 that these “spreadsheet”-type datasets are called data frames in R. We’ll focus on working with data saved as data frames throughout this book. Let’s first load all the packages needed for this chapter, assuming you’ve already installed them. Read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages if you haven’t already. library(nycflights23) library(dplyr) library(knitr) At the beginning of all subsequent chapters in this book, we’ll always have a list of packages that you should have installed and loaded in order to work with that chapter’s R code. 1.4.1 nycflights23 package Many of us have flown on airplanes or know someone who has. Air travel has become an ever-present aspect of many people’s lives. If you look at the Departures flight information board at an airport, you will frequently see that some flights are delayed for a variety of reasons. Are there ways that we can understand the reasons that cause flight delays? We’d all like to arrive at our destinations on time whenever possible. (Unless you secretly love hanging out at airports. If you are one of these people, pretend for a moment that you are very much anticipating being at your final destination.) Throughout this book, we’re going to analyze data related to all domestic flights departing from one of New York City’s three main airports in 2023: Newark Liberty International (EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), and LaGuardia Airport (LGA). We’ll access this data using the nycflights23 R package, which contains five datasets saved in five data frames: flights: Information on all flights. airlines: A table matching airline names and their two-letter International Air Transport Association (IATA) airline codes (also known as carrier codes) for 14 airline companies. For example, “DL” is the two-letter code for Delta. planes: Information about each of the 4,840 physical aircraft used. weather: Hourly meteorological data for each of the three NYC airports. This data frame has 26,204 rows, roughly corresponding to the \\(365 \\times 24 \\times 3 = 26,280\\) possible hourly measurements one can observe at three locations over the course of a year. airports: Names, codes, and locations of the 1,251 domestic destinations. The nycflights23 package is an updated version of the classic nycflights13 R package. nycflights23 was authored by ModernDive co-author Chester Ismay using the anyflights R package developed by Simon Couch. Simon granted permission to the ModernDive team to use the data in the anyflights package to create nycflights23 and submit the package to CRAN. 1.4.2 flights data frame We’ll begin by exploring the flights data frame and get an idea of its structure. Run the following code in your console, either by typing it or by cutting-and-pasting it. It displays the contents of the flights data frame in your console. Note that depending on the size of your monitor, the output may vary slightly. flights # A tibble: 435,352 × 19 year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 2023 1 1 1 2038 203 328 3 2 2023 1 1 18 2300 78 228 135 3 2023 1 1 31 2344 47 500 426 4 2023 1 1 33 2140 173 238 2352 5 2023 1 1 36 2048 228 223 2252 6 2023 1 1 503 500 3 808 815 7 2023 1 1 520 510 10 948 949 8 2023 1 1 524 530 -6 645 710 9 2023 1 1 537 520 17 926 818 10 2023 1 1 547 545 2 845 852 # ℹ 435,342 more rows # ℹ 11 more variables: arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;, # tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;, # hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; Let’s unpack this output: A tibble: 435,352 x 19: A tibble is a specific kind of data frame in R. This particular data frame has 435,352 rows corresponding to different observations. Here, each observation is a flight. 19 columns corresponding to 19 variables describing each observation. year, month, day, dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, and arr_time are the different columns, in other words, the different variables of this dataset. We then have a preview of the first 10 rows of observations corresponding to the first 10 flights. R is only showing the first 10 rows, because if it showed all 435,352 rows, it would overwhelm your screen. ... with 435,342 more rows` and 11 more variables: indicating to us that 435,342 more rows of data and 11 more variables could not fit in this screen. Unfortunately, this output does not allow us to explore the data very well, but it does give a nice preview. Let’s look at some different ways to explore data frames. 1.4.3 Exploring data frames There are many ways to get a feel for the data contained in a data frame such as flights. We present three functions that take as their “argument” (their input) the data frame in question. We also include a fourth method for exploring one particular column of a data frame: Using the View() function, which brings up RStudio’s built-in data viewer. Using the glimpse() function, which is included in the dplyr package. Using the kable() function, which is included in the knitr package. Using the $ “extraction operator,” which is used to view a single variable/column in a data frame. 1. View(): Run View(flights) in your console in RStudio, either by typing it or cutting-and-pasting it into the console pane. Explore this data frame in the resulting pop up viewer. You should get into the habit of viewing any data frames you encounter. Note the uppercase V in View(). R is case-sensitive, so you’ll get an error message if you run view(flights) instead of View(flights). Learning check (LC1.3) What does any ONE row in this flights dataset refer to? A. Data on an airline B. Data on a flight C. Data on an airport D. Data on multiple flights By running View(flights), we can explore the different variables listed in the columns. Observe that there are many different types of variables. Some of the variables like distance, day, and arr_delay are what we will call quantitative variables. These variables are numerical in nature. Other variables here are categorical. Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the View(flights) output, you will see a column of numbers. These are the row numbers of the dataset. If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row is representing. This will allow you to identify what object is being described in a given row by taking note of the values of the columns in that specific row. This is often called the observational unit. The observational unit in this example is an individual flight departing from New York City in 2023. You can identify the observational unit by determining what “thing” is being measured or described by each of the variables. We’ll talk more about observational units in Subsection 1.4.4 on identification and measurement variables. 2. glimpse(): The second way we’ll cover to explore a data frame is using the glimpse() function included in the dplyr package. Thus, you can only use the glimpse() function after you’ve loaded the dplyr package by running library(dplyr). This function provides us with an alternative perspective for exploring a data frame than the View() function: glimpse(flights) Rows: 435,352 Columns: 19 $ year &lt;int&gt; 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2… $ month &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… $ day &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… $ dep_time &lt;int&gt; 1, 18, 31, 33, 36, 503, 520, 524, 537, 547, 549, 551, 5… $ sched_dep_time &lt;int&gt; 2038, 2300, 2344, 2140, 2048, 500, 510, 530, 520, 545, … $ dep_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 203, 78, 47, 173, 228, 3, 10, -6, 17, 2, -10, -9, -7, -… $ arr_time &lt;int&gt; 328, 228, 500, 238, 223, 808, 948, 645, 926, 845, 905, … $ sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt; 3, 135, 426, 2352, 2252, 815, 949, 710, 818, 852, 901, … $ arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 205, 53, 34, 166, 211, -7, -1, -25, 68, -7, 4, -13, -14… $ carrier &lt;chr&gt; &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;DL&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;… $ flight &lt;int&gt; 628, 393, 371, 1053, 219, 499, 996, 981, 206, 225, 800,… $ tailnum &lt;chr&gt; &quot;N25201&quot;, &quot;N830DN&quot;, &quot;N807JB&quot;, &quot;N265JB&quot;, &quot;N17730&quot;, &quot;N925… $ origin &lt;chr&gt; &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;,… $ dest &lt;chr&gt; &quot;SMF&quot;, &quot;ATL&quot;, &quot;BQN&quot;, &quot;CHS&quot;, &quot;DTW&quot;, &quot;MIA&quot;, &quot;BQN&quot;, &quot;ORD&quot;,… $ air_time &lt;dbl&gt; 367, 108, 190, 108, 80, 154, 192, 119, 258, 157, 164, 1… $ distance &lt;dbl&gt; 2500, 760, 1576, 636, 488, 1085, 1576, 719, 1400, 1065,… $ hour &lt;dbl&gt; 20, 23, 23, 21, 20, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6,… $ minute &lt;dbl&gt; 38, 0, 44, 40, 48, 0, 10, 30, 20, 45, 59, 0, 59, 0, 0, … $ time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; 2023-01-01 20:00:00, 2023-01-01 23:00:00, 2023-01-01 2… Observe that glimpse() will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable name. In addition, the data type (see Subsection 1.2.1) of the variable is given immediately after each variable’s name inside &lt; &gt;. Here, int and dbl refer to “integer” and “double”, which are computer coding terminology for quantitative/numerical variables. “Doubles” take up twice the size to store on a computer compared to integers. In contrast, chr refers to “character”, which is computer terminology for text data. In most forms, text data, such as the carrier or origin of a flight, are categorical variables. The time_hour variable is another data type: dttm. These types of variables represent date and time combinations. However, we won’t work with dates and times in this book; we leave this topic for other data science books like Data Science: A First Introduction by Tiffany-Anne Timbers, Melissa Lee, and Trevor Campbell or R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2017). Learning check (LC1.4) What are some other examples in this dataset of categorical variables? What makes them different than quantitative variables? 3. kable(): The final way to explore the entirety of a data frame is using the kable() function from the knitr package. Let’s explore the different carrier codes for all the airlines in our dataset two ways. Run both of these lines of code in the console: airlines kable(airlines) At first glance, it may not appear that there is much difference in the outputs. However, when using tools for producing reproducible reports such as R Markdown, the latter code produces output that is much more legible and reader-friendly. You’ll see us use this reader-friendly style in many places in the book when we want to print a data frame as a nice table. 4. $ operator Lastly, the $ operator allows us to extract and then explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console: airlines$name We used the $ operator to extract only the name variable and return it as a vector of length 16. We’ll only be occasionally exploring data frames using the $ operator, instead favoring the View() and glimpse() functions. 1.4.4 Identification and measurement variables There is a subtle difference between the kinds of variables that you will encounter in data frames. There are identification variables and measurement variables. For example, let’s explore the airports data frame by showing the output of glimpse(airports): glimpse(airports) Rows: 1,251 Columns: 8 $ faa &lt;chr&gt; &quot;AAF&quot;, &quot;AAP&quot;, &quot;ABE&quot;, &quot;ABI&quot;, &quot;ABL&quot;, &quot;ABQ&quot;, &quot;ABR&quot;, &quot;ABY&quot;, &quot;ACK&quot;, &quot;… $ name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Apalachicola Regional Airport&quot;, &quot;Andrau Airpark&quot;, &quot;Lehigh Valle… $ lat &lt;dbl&gt; 29.7, 29.7, 40.7, 32.4, 67.1, 35.0, 45.4, 31.5, 41.3, 31.6, 41.0… $ lon &lt;dbl&gt; -85.0, -95.6, -75.4, -99.7, -157.9, -106.6, -98.4, -84.2, -70.1,… $ alt &lt;dbl&gt; 20, 79, 393, 1791, 334, 5355, 1302, 197, 47, 516, 221, 75, 18, 7… $ tz &lt;dbl&gt; -5, -6, -5, -6, -9, -7, -6, -5, -5, -6, -8, -5, -10, -6, -9, -6,… $ dst &lt;chr&gt; &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;,… $ tzone &lt;chr&gt; &quot;America/New_York&quot;, &quot;America/Chicago&quot;, &quot;America/New_York&quot;, &quot;Amer… The variables faa and name are what we will call identification variables, variables that uniquely identify each observational unit. In this case, the identification variables uniquely identify airports. Such variables are mainly used in practice to uniquely identify each row in a data frame. faa gives the unique code provided by the FAA for that airport, while the name variable gives the longer official name of the airport. The remaining variables (lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, tzone) are often called measurement or characteristic variables: variables that describe properties of each observational unit. For example, lat and long describe the latitude and longitude of each airport. Furthermore, sometimes a single variable might not be enough to uniquely identify each observational unit: combinations of variables might be needed. While it is not an absolute rule, for organizational purposes it is considered good practice to have your identification variables in the leftmost columns of your data frame. Learning check (LC1.5) What properties of each airport do the variables lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, and tzone describe in the airports data frame? Take your best guess. (LC1.6) Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables where one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not. Further, create your own tidy data frame that matches these conditions. 1.4.5 Help files Another nice feature of R are help files, which provide documentation for various functions and datasets. You can bring up help files by adding a ? before the name of a function or data frame and then run this in the console. You will then be presented with a page showing the corresponding documentation if it exists. For example, let’s look at the help file for the flights data frame. ?flights The help file should pop up in the Help pane of RStudio. If you have questions about a function or data frame included in an R package, you should get in the habit of consulting the help file right away. Learning check (LC1.7) Look at the help file for the airports data frame. Revise your earlier guesses about what the variables lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, and tzone each describe. 1.5 Conclusion We’ve given you what we feel is a minimally viable set of tools to explore data in R. Does this chapter contain everything you need to know? Absolutely not. To try to include everything in this chapter would make the chapter so large it wouldn’t be useful! As we said earlier, the best way to add to your toolbox is to get into RStudio and run and write code as much as possible. 1.5.1 Additional resources If you are new to the world of coding, R, and RStudio and feel you could benefit from a more detailed introduction, we suggest you check out the short book, Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown (Ismay and Kennedy 2016). It includes screencast recordings that you can follow along and pause as you learn. This book also contains an introduction to R Markdown, a tool used for reproducible research in R. FIGURE 1.6: Preview of Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown. 1.5.2 What’s to come? We’re now going to start the “Data Science with tidyverse” portion of this book in Chapter 2 as shown in Figure 1.7 with what we feel is the most important tool in a data scientist’s toolbox: data visualization. We’ll continue to explore the data included in the moderndive and nycflights23 packages using the ggplot2 package for data visualization. You’ll see that data visualization is a powerful tool to add to your toolbox for data exploration that provides additional insight to what the View() and glimpse() functions can provide.

By visualizing data, we gain valuable insights we couldn’t initially obtain from just looking at the raw data values. We’ll use the ggplot2 package, as it provides an easy way to customize your plots. ggplot2 is rooted in the data visualization theory known as the grammar of graphics (Wilkinson 2005), developed by Leland Wilkinson. At their most basic, graphics/plots/charts (we use these terms interchangeably in this book) provide a nice way to explore the patterns in data, such as the presence of outliers, distributions of individual variables, and relationships between groups of variables. Graphics are designed to emphasize the findings and insights you want your audience to understand. This does, however, require a balancing act. On the one hand, you want to highlight as many interesting findings as possible. On the other hand, you don’t want to include so much information that it overwhelms your audience. As we will see, plots also help us to identify patterns and outliers in our data. We’ll see that a common extension of these ideas is to compare the distribution of one numerical variable, such as what are the center and spread of the values, as we go across the levels of a different categorical variable. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(nycflights23) library(ggplot2) library(moderndive) 2.1 The grammar of graphics We start with a discussion of a theoretical framework for data visualization known as “the grammar of graphics.” This framework serves as the foundation for the ggplot2 package which we’ll use extensively in this chapter. Think of how we construct and form sentences in English by combining different elements, like nouns, verbs, articles, subjects, objects, etc. We can’t just combine these elements in any arbitrary order; we must do so following a set of rules known as a linguistic grammar. Similarly to a linguistic grammar, “the grammar of graphics” defines a set of rules for constructing statistical graphics by combining different types of layers. This grammar was created by Leland Wilkinson (Wilkinson 2005) and has been implemented in a variety of data visualization software platforms like R, but also Plotly and Tableau. 2.1.1 Components of the grammar In short, the grammar tells us that: A statistical graphic is a mapping of data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects. Specifically, we can break a graphic into the following three essential components: data: the dataset containing the variables of interest. geom: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars. aes: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset. You might be wondering why we wrote the terms data, geom, and aes in a computer code type font. We’ll see very shortly that we’ll specify the elements of the grammar in R using these terms. However, let’s first break down the grammar with an example. 2.1.2 Gapminder data In February 2006, a Swedish physician and data advocate named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled “The best stats you’ve ever seen” where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website gapminder.org. For example, for data on 142 countries in 2007, let’s consider only a few countries in Table 2.1 as a peek into the data. TABLE 2.1: Gapminder 2007 Data: First 3 of 142 countries Country Continent Life Expectancy Population GDP per Capita Afghanistan Asia 43.8 31889923 975 Albania Europe 76.4 3600523 5937 Algeria Africa 72.3 33333216 6223 Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns: Country: Name of country. Continent: Which of the five continents the country is part of. Note that “Americas” includes countries in both North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded. Life Expectancy: Life expectancy in years. Population: Number of people living in the country. GDP per Capita: Gross domestic product (in US dollars). Now consider Figure 2.1, which plots this for all 142 of the data’s countries. FIGURE 2.1: Life expectancy over GDP per capita in 2007. Let’s view this plot through the grammar of graphics: The data variable GDP per Capita gets mapped to the x-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Life Expectancy gets mapped to the y-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Population gets mapped to the size aesthetic of the points. The data variable Continent gets mapped to the color aesthetic of the points. We’ll see shortly that data corresponds to the particular data frame where our data is saved and that “data variables” correspond to particular columns in the data frame. Furthermore, the type of geometric object considered in this plot are points. That being said, while in this example we are considering points, graphics are not limited to just points. We can also use lines, bars, and other geometric objects. Let’s summarize the three essential components of the grammar in Table 2.2. TABLE 2.2: Summary of the grammar of graphics for this plot data variable aes geom GDP per Capita x point Life Expectancy y point Population size point Continent color point 2.1.3 Other components There are other components of the grammar of graphics we can control as well. As you start to delve deeper into the grammar of graphics, you’ll start to encounter these topics more frequently. In this book, we’ll keep things simple and only work with these two additional components: faceting breaks up a plot into several plots split by the values of another variable (Section 2.6) position adjustments for barplots (Section 2.8) Other more complex components like scales and coordinate systems are left for a more advanced text such as R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2017). Generally speaking, the grammar of graphics allows for a high degree of customization of plots and also a consistent framework for easily updating and modifying them. 2.1.4 ggplot2 package In this book, we will use the ggplot2 package for data visualization, which is an implementation of the grammar of graphics for R (Wickham et al. 2024). As we noted earlier, a lot of the previous section was written in a computer code type font. This is because the various components of the grammar of graphics are specified in the ggplot() function included in the ggplot2 package. For the purposes of this book, we’ll always provide the ggplot() function with the following arguments (i.e., inputs) at a minimum: The data frame where the variables exist: the data argument. The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the mapping argument which specifies the aesthetic attributes involved. After we’ve specified these components, we then add layers to the plot using the + sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the layer that specifies which type of geometric object we want the plot to involve: points, lines, bars, and others. Other layers we can add to a plot include the plot title, axes labels, visual themes for the plots, and facets (which we’ll see in Section 2.6). Let’s now put the theory of the grammar of graphics into practice. 2.2 Five named graphs - the 5NG In order to keep things simple in this book, we will only focus on five different types of graphics, each with a commonly given name. We term these “five named graphs” or in abbreviated form, the 5NG: scatterplots linegraphs histograms boxplots barplots We’ll also present some variations of these plots, but with this basic repertoire of five graphics in your toolbox, you can visualize a wide array of different variable types. Note that certain plots are only appropriate for categorical variables, while others are only appropriate for numerical variables. 2.3 5NG#1: Scatterplots The simplest of the 5NG are scatterplots, also called bivariate plots. They allow you to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. While you may already be familiar with scatterplots, let’s view them through the lens of the grammar of graphics we presented in Section 2.1. Specifically, we will visualize the relationship between the following two numerical variables in the envoy_flights data frame included in the moderndive package: dep_delay: departure delay on the horizontal “x” axis and arr_delay: arrival delay on the vertical “y” axis for Envoy Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2023. In other words, envoy_flights does not consist of all flights that left NYC in 2023, but rather only those flights where carrier is MQ (which is Envoy Airlines’ carrier code). Learning check (LC2.1) Take a look at both the flights data frame from the nycflights23 package and the envoy_flights data frame from the moderndive package by running View(flights) and View(envoy_flights). In what respect do these data frames differ? For example, think about the number of rows in each dataset. 2.3.1 Scatterplots via geom_point Let’s now go over the code that will create the desired scatterplot, while keeping in mind the grammar of graphics framework we introduced in Section 2.1. Let’s take a look at the code and break it down piece-by-piece. ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point() Within the ggplot() function, we specify two of the components of the grammar of graphics as arguments (i.e., inputs): The data as the envoy_flights data frame via data = envoy_flights. The aesthetic mapping by setting mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay). Specifically, the variable dep_delay maps to the x position aesthetic, while the variable arr_delay maps to the y position. We then add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign. The added layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object. In this case, the geometric object is set to be points by specifying geom_point(). After running these two lines of code in your console, you’ll notice two outputs: a warning message and the graphic shown in Figure 2.2. Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range (`geom_point()`). FIGURE 2.2: Arrival delays versus departure delays for Envoy Air flights from NYC in 2023. Let’s first unpack the graphic in Figure 2.2. Observe that a positive relationship exists between dep_delay and arr_delay: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase. Observe also the large mass of points clustered near (0, 0), the point indicating flights that neither departed nor arrived late. Let’s turn our attention to the warning message. R is alerting us to the fact that three rows were ignored due to them being missing. For these three rows, either the value for dep_delay or arr_delay or both were missing (recorded in R as NA), and thus these rows were ignored in our plot. Before we continue, let’s make a few more observations about this code that created the scatterplot. Note that the + sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning. You’ll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning of a line. When adding layers to a plot, you are encouraged to start a new line after the + (by pressing the Return/Enter button on your keyboard) so that the code for each layer is on a new line. As we add more and more layers to plots, you’ll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code. To stress the importance of adding the layer specifying the geometric object, consider Figure 2.3 where no layers are added. Because the geometric object was not specified, we have a blank plot which is not very useful! ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) FIGURE 2.3: A plot with no layers. Learning check (LC2.2) What are some practical reasons why dep_delay and arr_delay have a positive relationship? (LC2.3) What variables in the weather data frame would you expect to have a negative correlation (i.e., a negative relationship) with dep_delay? Why? Remember that we are focusing on numerical variables here. Hint: Explore the weather dataset by using the View() function. (LC2.4) Why do you believe there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Envoy Air flights? (LC2.5) What are some other features of the plot that stand out to you? (LC2.6) Create a new scatterplot using different variables in the envoy_flights data frame by modifying the example given. 2.3.2 Overplotting The large mass of points near (0, 0) in Figure 2.2 can cause some confusion since it is hard to tell the true number of points that are plotted. This is the result of a phenomenon called overplotting. As one may guess, this corresponds to points being plotted on top of each other over and over again. When overplotting occurs, it is difficult to know the number of points being plotted. There are two methods to address the issue of overplotting. Either by Adjusting the transparency of the points or Adding a little random “jitter”, or random “nudges”, to each of the points. Method 1: Changing the transparency The first way of addressing overplotting is to change the transparency/opacity of the points by setting the alpha argument in geom_point(). We can change the alpha argument to be any value between 0 and 1, where 0 sets the points to be 100% transparent and 1 sets the points to be 100% opaque. By default, alpha is set to 1. In other words, if we don’t explicitly set an alpha value, R will use alpha = 1. Note how the following code is identical to the code in Section 2.3 that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with alpha = 0.2 added to the geom_point() function: ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) FIGURE 2.4: Arrival vs. departure delays scatterplot with alpha = 0.2. The key feature to note in Figure 2.4 is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. Note furthermore that there is no aes() surrounding alpha = 0.2. This is because we are not mapping a variable to an aesthetic attribute, but rather merely changing the default setting of alpha. In fact, you’ll receive an error if you try to change the second line to read geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2)). Method 2: Jittering the points The second way of addressing overplotting is by jittering all the points. This means giving each point a small “nudge” in a random direction. You can think of “jittering” as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Let’s illustrate using a simple example first. Say we have a data frame with 4 identical rows of x and y values: (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), and (0,0). In Figure 2.5, we present both the regular scatterplot of these 4 points (on the left) and its jittered counterpart (on the right). FIGURE 2.5: Regular and jittered scatterplot. In the left-hand regular scatterplot, observe that the 4 points are superimposed on top of each other. While we know there are 4 values being plotted, this fact might not be apparent to others. In the right-hand jittered scatterplot, it is now plainly evident that this plot involves four points since each point is given a random “nudge.” Keep in mind, however, that jittering is strictly a visualization tool; even after creating a jittered scatterplot, the original values saved in the data frame remain unchanged. To create a jittered scatterplot, instead of using geom_point(), we use geom_jitter(). Observe how the following code is very similar to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting in Subsection 2.3.1, but with geom_point() replaced with geom_jitter(). ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) FIGURE 2.6: Arrival versus departure delays jittered scatterplot. In order to specify how much jitter to add, we adjusted the width and height arguments to geom_jitter(). This corresponds to how hard you’d like to shake the plot in horizontal x-axis units and vertical y-axis units, respectively. In this case, both axes are in minutes. How much jitter should we add using the width and height arguments? On the one hand, it is important to add just enough jitter to break any overlap in points, but on the other hand, not so much that we completely alter the original pattern in points. As can be seen in the resulting Figure 2.6, in this case jittering doesn’t really provide much new insight. In this particular case, it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting alpha proved more effective. When would it be better to use a jittered scatterplot? When would it be better to alter the points’ transparency? There is no single right answer that applies to all situations. You need to make a subjective choice and own that choice. At the very least when confronted with overplotting, however, we suggest you make both types of plots and see which one better emphasizes the point you are trying to make. Learning check (LC2.7) Why is setting the alpha argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? (LC2.8) After viewing Figure 2.4, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur most frequently. How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without alpha = 0.2 set in Figure 2.2? 2.3.3 Summary Scatterplots display the relationship between two numerical variables. They are among the most commonly used plots because they can provide an immediate way to see the trend in one numerical variable versus another. However, if you try to create a scatterplot where either one of the two variables is not numerical, you might get strange results. Be careful! With medium to large datasets, you may need to play around with the different modifications to scatterplots we saw such as changing the transparency/opacity of the points or by jittering the points. This tweaking is often a fun part of data visualization, since you’ll have the chance to see different relationships emerge as you tinker with your plots. 2.4 5NG#2: Linegraphs The next of the five named graphs are linegraphs. Linegraphs show the relationship between two numerical variables when the variable on the x-axis, also called the explanatory variable, is of a sequential nature. In other words, there is an inherent ordering to the variable. The most common examples of linegraphs have some notion of time on the x-axis: hours, days, weeks, years, etc. Since time is sequential, we connect consecutive observations of the variable on the y-axis with a line. Linegraphs that have some notion of time on the x-axis are also called time series plots. Let’s illustrate linegraphs using another dataset in the nycflights23 package: the weather data frame. Let’s explore the weather data frame from the nycflights23 package by running View(weather) and glimpse(weather). Furthermore let’s read the associated help file by running ?weather to bring up the help file. Observe that there is a variable called temp of hourly wind speed recordings in miles per hour at weather stations near all three major airports in New York City: Newark (origin code EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), and LaGuardia (LGA). However, instead of considering hourly wind speeds for all days in 2023 for all three airports, for simplicity let’s only consider hourly wind speeds at Newark airport for the first 15 days in January. This data is accessible in the early_january_2023_weather data frame included in the moderndive package. In other words, early_january_2023_weather contains hourly weather observations for origin equal to EWR (Newark’s airport code), month equal to 1, and day less than or equal to 15. Learning check (LC2.9) Take a look at both the weather data frame from the nycflights23 package and the early_january_2023_weather data frame from the moderndive package by running View(weather) and View(early_january_2023_weather). In what respect do these data frames differ? (LC2.10) View() the flights data frame again. Why does the time_hour variable uniquely identify the hour of the measurement, whereas the hour variable does not? 2.4.1 Linegraphs via geom_line Let’s create a time series plot of the hourly wind speeds saved in the early_january_2023_weather data frame by using geom_line() to create a linegraph, instead of using geom_point() like we used previously to create scatterplots: ggplot(data = early_january_2023_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = wind_speed)) + geom_line() FIGURE 2.7: Hourly wind speed in Newark for January 1-15, 2023. Much as with the ggplot() code that created the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Envoy Air flights in Figure 2.2, let’s break down this code piece-by-piece in terms of the grammar of graphics: Within the ggplot() function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar of graphics as arguments: The data to be the early_january_2023_weather data frame by setting data = early_january_2023_weather. The aesthetic mapping by setting mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp). Specifically, the variable time_hour maps to the x position aesthetic, while the variable wind_speed maps to the y position aesthetic. We add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object in question. In this case, the geometric object is a line set by specifying geom_line(). Learning check (LC2.11) Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? (LC2.12) Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable on the x-axis? (LC2.13) Plot a time series of a variable other than wind_speed for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2023. Try to select a variable that doesn’t have a lot of missing (NA) values. 2.4.2 Summary Linegraphs, just like scatterplots, display the relationship between two numerical variables. However, it is preferred to use linegraphs over scatterplots when the variable on the x-axis (i.e., the explanatory variable) has an inherent ordering, such as some notion of time. 2.5 5NG#3: Histograms Let’s consider the wind_speed variable in the weather data frame once again, but unlike with the linegraphs in Section 2.4, let’s say we don’t care about its relationship with time, but rather we only care about how the values of wind_speed distribute. In other words: What are the smallest and largest values? What is the “center” or “most typical” value? How do the values spread out? What are frequent and infrequent values? One way to visualize this distribution of this single variable wind_speed is to plot them on a horizontal line as we do in Figure 2.8: FIGURE 2.8: Plot of hourly wind speed recordings from NYC in 2023. This gives us a general idea of how the values of wind_speed distribute: observe that wind speeds vary from around 0 miles per hour (0 kilometers per hour ) up to 38 miles per hour (approximately 61 kilometers per hour). There appear to be more recorded wind speeds between 0 and 20 miles per hour (mph) than outside this range. However, because of the high degree of overplotting in the points, it’s hard to get a sense of exactly how many values are between, say, 10 mph and 15 mph. What is commonly produced instead of Figure 2.8 is known as a histogram. A histogram is a plot that visualizes the distribution of a numerical value as follows: We first cut up the x-axis into a series of bins, where each bin represents a range of values. For each bin, we count the number of observations that fall in the range corresponding to that bin. Then for each bin, we draw a bar whose height marks the corresponding count. Let’s drill-down on an example of a histogram, shown in Figure 2.9. FIGURE 2.9: Example histogram. Let’s focus only on wind speeds between 10 mph and 25 mph for now. Observe that there are three bins of equal width between 10 mph and 25 mph. Thus we have three bins of width 5 mph each: one bin for the 10-15 mph range, another bin for the 15-20 mph range, and another bin for the 20-25 mph range. Since: The bin for the 10-15 mph range has a height of around 8000. In other words, around 8000 of the hourly wind speed recordings are between 10 mph and 15 mph. The bin for the 15-20 mph range has a height of around 2400. In other words, around 2400 of the hourly wind speed recordings are between 15 mph and 20 mph. The bin for the 20-25 mph range has a height of around 700. In other words, around 700 of the hourly wind speed recordings are between 20 mph and 25 mph. All eight bins spanning 0 mph to 40 mph on the x-axis have this interpretation. 2.5.1 Histograms via geom_histogram Let’s now present the ggplot() code to plot your first histogram! Unlike with scatterplots and linegraphs, there is now only one variable being mapped in aes(): the single numerical variable wind_speed. The y-aesthetic of a histogram, the count of the observations in each bin, gets computed for you automatically. Furthermore, the geometric object layer is now a geom_histogram(). After running the following code, you’ll see the histogram in Figure 2.10 as well as warning messages. We’ll discuss the warning messages first. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram() `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Warning: Removed 1033 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range (`stat_bin()`). FIGURE 2.10: Histogram of hourly wind speeds at three NYC airports. The first message is telling us that the histogram was constructed using bins = 30 for 30 equally spaced bins. This is known in computer programming as a default value; unless you override this default number of bins with a number you specify, R will choose 30 by default. We’ll see in the next section how to change the number of bins to another value than the default. The second message is telling us something similar to the warning message we received when we ran the code to create a scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Envoy Air flights in Figure 2.2: that because some rows have missing NA value for wind_speed, they were omitted from the histogram. R is just giving us a friendly heads-up that this was the case. Now let’s unpack the resulting histogram in Figure 2.10. Observe that values above 30 mph are rather rare. However, because of the large number of bins, it’s hard to get a sense for which range of wind speeds is spanned by each bin; everything is one giant amorphous blob. So let’s add white vertical borders demarcating the bins by adding a color = \"white\" argument to geom_histogram() and ignore the warning about setting the number of bins to a better value: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 2.11: Histogram of hourly wind speeds at three NYC airports with white borders. We now have an easier time associating ranges of wind speeds to each of the bins in Figure 2.11. We can also vary the color of the bars by setting the fill argument. For example, you can set the bin colors to be “blue steel” by setting fill = \"steelblue\": ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) If you’re curious, run colors() to see all 657 possible choice of colors in R! 2.5.2 Adjusting the bins Observe in Figure 2.11 that in the 10-20 mph range there appear to be roughly 8 bins. Thus each bin has width 10 divided by 8, or 1.125 mph, which is not a very easily interpretable range to work with. Let’s improve this by adjusting the number of bins in our histogram in one of two ways: By adjusting the number of bins via the bins argument to geom_histogram(). By adjusting the width of the bins via the binwidth argument to geom_histogram(). Using the first method, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to cut the x-axis up in. As mentioned in the previous section, the default number of bins is 20. We can override this default, to say 20 bins, as follows: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = &quot;white&quot;) Using the second method, instead of specifying the number of bins, we specify the width of the bins by using the binwidth argument in the geom_histogram() layer. For example, let’s set the width of each bin to be five mph. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) We compare both resulting histograms side-by-side in Figure 2.12. FIGURE 2.12: Setting histogram bins in two ways. Learning check (LC2.14) What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 20 tell us about the distribution of wind speeds? (LC2.15) Would you classify the distribution of wind speeds as symmetric or skewed in one direction or another? (LC2.16) What would you guess is the “center” value in this distribution? Why did you make that choice? (LC2.17) Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close? Why? 2.5.3 Summary Histograms, unlike scatterplots and linegraphs, present information on only a single numerical variable. Specifically, they are visualizations of the distribution of the numerical variable in question. 2.6 Facets Before continuing with the next of the 5NG, let’s briefly introduce a new concept called faceting. Faceting is used when we’d like to split a particular visualization by the values of another variable. This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ. For example, suppose we were interested in looking at how the histogram of hourly wind speed recordings at the three NYC airports we saw in Figure 2.9 differed in each month. We could “split” this histogram by the 12 possible months in a given year. In other words, we would plot histograms of wind_speed for each month separately. We do this by adding facet_wrap(~ month) layer. Note the ~ is a “tilde” and can generally be found on the key next to the “1” key on US keyboards. The tilde is required and you’ll receive the error Error in as.quoted(facets) : object 'month' not found if you don’t include it here. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ month) FIGURE 2.13: Faceted histogram of hourly wind speeds by month. We can also specify the number of rows and columns in the grid by using the nrow and ncol arguments inside of facet_wrap(). For example, say we would like our faceted histogram to have 4 rows instead of 3. We simply add an nrow = 4 argument to facet_wrap(~ month). ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ month, nrow = 4) FIGURE 2.14: Faceted histogram with 4 instead of 3 rows. Observe in both Figures 2.13 and 2.14 the majority of wind speed observations for all months are clustered between 0 and 20 mph, with very few observations exceeding 30 mph. The histograms show a similar shape across months, with most distributions having a similar largest count and a few larger speed outliers, indicating that lower wind speeds are more common than higher wind speeds. Learning check (LC2.18) What other things do you notice about this faceted plot? How does a faceted plot help us see relationships between two variables? (LC2.19) What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot? What about 10, 20, and 30? (LC2.20) For which types of datasets would faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the nature of these variables and other important characteristics. (LC2.21) Does the wind_speed variable in the weather dataset have a lot of variability? Why do you say that? 2.7 5NG#4: Boxplots While faceted histograms are one type of visualization used to compare the distribution of a numerical variable split by the values of another variable, another type of visualization that achieves this same goal is a side-by-side boxplot. A boxplot is constructed from the information provided in the five-number summary of a numerical variable (see Appendix A.1). To keep things simple for now, let’s only consider the 2057 recorded hourly wind speed recordings for the month of April, each represented as a jittered point in Figure 2.15. FIGURE 2.15: April wind speeds represented as jittered points. These 2057 observations have the following five-number summary: Minimum: 0 mph First quartile (25th percentile): 5.8 mph Median (second quartile, 50th percentile): 9.2 mph Third quartile (75th percentile): 12.7 mph Maximum: 29.92 mph In the leftmost plot of Figure 2.16, let’s mark these 5 values with dashed horizontal lines on top of the 2057 points. In the middle plot of Figure 2.16 let’s add the boxplot. In the rightmost plot of Figure 2.16, let’s remove the points and the dashed horizontal lines for clarity’s sake. FIGURE 2.16: Building up a boxplot of April wind speeds. What the boxplot does is visually summarize the 2057 points by cutting the wind speed recordings into quartiles at the dashed lines, where each quartile contains roughly 2057 \\(\\div\\) 4 \\(\\approx\\) 514 observations. Thus 25% of points fall below the bottom edge of the box, which is the first quartile of 5.8 mph. In other words, 25% of observations were below 5.8 mph. 25% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line, which is the median of 9.2 mph. Thus, 25% of observations were between 5.8 mph and 9.2 mph and 50% of observations were below 9.2 mph. 25% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box, which is the third quartile of 12.7 mph. It follows that 25% of observations were between 9.2 mph and 12.7 mph and 75% of observations were below 12.7 mph. 25% of points fall above the top edge of the box. In other words, 25% of observations were above 12.7 mph. The middle 50% of points lie within the interquartile range (IQR) between the first and third quartile. Thus, the IQR for this example is 12.7 - 5.8 = 6.905 mph. The interquartile range is a measure of a numerical variable’s spread. Furthermore, in the rightmost plot of Figure 2.16, we see the whiskers of the boxplot. The whiskers stick out from either end of the box all the way to the minimum and maximum observed wind speeds of 0 mph and 29.92 mph, respectively. However, the whiskers don’t always extend to the smallest and largest observed values as they do here. They in fact extend no more than 1.5 \\(\\times\\) the interquartile range from either end of the box, in this case of the April wind speeds, no more than 1.5 \\(\\times\\) 6.905 mph = 10.357 mph from either end of the box. Any observed values outside this range get marked with points called outliers, which are marked here, and we’ll discuss further in the next section. 2.7.1 Boxplots via geom_boxplot Let’s now create a side-by-side boxplot of hourly wind speeds split by the 12 months as we did previously with the faceted histograms. We do this by mapping the month variable to the x-position aesthetic, the wind_speed variable to the y-position aesthetic, and by adding a geom_boxplot() layer: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = wind_speed)) + geom_boxplot() FIGURE 2.17: Invalid boxplot specification. Warning message: 1: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? Observe in Figure 2.17 that this plot does not provide information about wind speed separated by month. The first warning message clues us in as to why. It is telling us that we have a “continuous”, or numerical variable, on the x-position aesthetic. Boxplots, however, require a categorical variable to be mapped to the x-position aesthetic. We can convert the numerical variable month into a factor categorical variable by using the factor() function. So after applying factor(month), month goes from having just the numerical values 1, 2, …, and 12 to having an associated ordering. With this ordering, ggplot() now knows how to work with this variable to produce the needed plot. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = wind_speed)) + geom_boxplot() FIGURE 2.18: Side-by-side boxplot of wind speed split by month. The resulting Figure 2.18 shows 12 separate “box and whiskers” plots similar to the rightmost plot of Figure 2.16 of only April wind speeds. Thus the different boxplots are shown “side-by-side.” The “box” portions of the visualization represent the 1st quartile, the median (the 2nd quartile), and the 3rd quartile. The height of each box (the value of the 3rd quartile minus the value of the 1st quartile) is the interquartile range (IQR). It is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability. The “whisker” portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and represent points less than the 25th percentile and greater than the 75th percentiles, respectively. They’re set to extend out no more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) units away from either end of the boxes. We say “no more than” because the ends of the whiskers have to correspond to observed wind speeds. The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability. The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called outliers. These can be thought of as anomalous (“out-of-the-ordinary”) values. It is important to keep in mind that the definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) units long for each boxplot. Looking at this side-by-side plot we can see that the months of February and March have higher median wind speeds as evidenced by the higher solid lines in the middle of the boxes. We can easily compare wind speeds across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the heights of the 12 boxes as quantified by the interquartile ranges are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of wind speeds recorded in a given month. Learning check (LC2.22) What do the dots at the top of the plot for January correspond to? Explain what might have occurred in January to produce these points. (LC2.23) Which months seem to have the highest variability in wind speed? What reasons can you give for this? (LC2.24) We looked at the distribution of the numerical variable wind_speed split by the numerical variable month that we converted using the factor() function in order to make a side-by-side boxplot. Why would a boxplot of wind_speed split by the numerical variable pressure similarly converted to a categorical variable using the factor() not be informative? (LC2.25) Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers. Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram? 2.7.2 Summary Side-by-side boxplots provide us with a way to compare the distribution of a numerical variable across multiple values of another variable. One can see where the median falls across the different groups by comparing the solid lines in the center of the boxes. To study the spread of a numerical variable within one of the boxes, look at both the length of the box and also how far the whiskers extend from either end of the box. Outliers are even more easily identified when looking at a boxplot than when looking at a histogram as they are marked with distinct points. 2.8 5NG#5: Barplots Both histograms and boxplots are tools to visualize the distribution of numerical variables. Another commonly desired task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, as we are simply counting different categories within a categorical variable, also known as the levels of the categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts, also known as frequencies, is with barplots (also called barcharts). One complication, however, is how your data is represented. Is the categorical variable of interest “pre-counted” or not? For example, run the following code that manually creates two data frames representing a collection of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. fruits &lt;- tibble( fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;) ) fruits_counted &lt;- tibble( fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), number = c(3, 2) ) We see both the fruits and fruits_counted data frames represent the same collection of fruit. Whereas fruits just lists the fruit individually… # A tibble: 5 × 1 fruit &lt;chr&gt; 1 apple 2 apple 3 orange 4 apple 5 orange … fruits_counted has a variable count which represent the “pre-counted” values of each fruit. # A tibble: 2 × 2 fruit number &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 apple 3 2 orange 2 Depending on how your categorical data is represented, you’ll need to add a different geometric layer type to your ggplot() to create a barplot, as we now explore. 2.8.1 Barplots via geom_bar or geom_col Let’s generate barplots using these two different representations of the same basket of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. Using the fruits data frame where all 5 fruits are listed individually in 5 rows, we map the fruit variable to the x-position aesthetic and add a geom_bar() layer: ggplot(data = fruits, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 2.19: Barplot when counts are not pre-counted. However, using the fruits_counted data frame where the fruits have been “pre-counted”, we once again map the fruit variable to the x-position aesthetic, but here we also map the count variable to the y-position aesthetic, and add a geom_col() layer instead. ggplot(data = fruits_counted, mapping = aes(x = fruit, y = number)) + geom_col() FIGURE 2.20: Barplot when counts are pre-counted. Compare the barplots in Figures 2.19 and 2.20. They are identical because they reflect counts of the same five fruits. However, depending on how our categorical data is represented, either “pre-counted” or not, we must add a different geom layer. When the categorical variable whose distribution you want to visualize Is not pre-counted in your data frame, we use geom_bar(). Is pre-counted in your data frame, we use geom_col() with the y-position aesthetic mapped to the variable that has the counts. Let’s now go back to the flights data frame in the nycflights23 package and visualize the distribution of the categorical variable carrier. In other words, let’s visualize the number of domestic flights out of New York City each airline company flew in 2023. Recall from Subsection 1.4.3 when you first explored the flights data frame, you saw that each row corresponds to a flight. In other words, the flights data frame is more like the fruits data frame than the fruits_counted data frame because the flights have not been pre-counted by carrier. Thus we should use geom_bar() instead of geom_col() to create a barplot. Much like a geom_histogram(), there is only one variable in the aes() aesthetic mapping: the variable carrier gets mapped to the x-position. As a difference though, histograms have bars that touch whereas bar graphs have white space between the bars going from left to right. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 2.21: Number of flights departing NYC in 2023 by airline using geom_bar(). Observe in Figure 2.21 that Republic Airline (YX), United Airlines (UA), and JetBlue Airways (B6) had the most flights depart NYC in 2023. If you don’t know which airlines correspond to which carrier codes, then run View(airlines) to see a directory of airlines. For example, AA is American Airlines Inc. Alternatively, say you had a data frame where the number of flights for each carrier was pre-counted as in Table 2.3. TABLE 2.3: Number of flights pre-counted for each carrier carrier number 9E 54141 AA 40525 AS 7843 B6 66169 DL 61562 F9 1286 G4 671 HA 366 MQ 357 NK 15189 OO 6432 UA 79641 WN 12385 YX 88785 In order to create a barplot visualizing the distribution of the categorical variable carrier in this case, we would now use geom_col() instead of geom_bar(), with an additional y = number in the aesthetic mapping on top of the x = carrier. The resulting barplot would be identical to Figure 2.21. Learning check (LC2.26) Why are histograms inappropriate for categorical variables? (LC2.27) What is the difference between histograms and barplots? (LC2.28) How many Alaska Air flights departed NYC in 2023? (LC2.29) What was the 7th highest airline for departed flights from NYC in 2023? How could we better present the table to get this answer quickly? 2.8.2 Must avoid pie charts! One of the most common plots used to visualize the distribution of categorical data is the pie chart. While they may seem harmless enough, pie charts actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well. As Naomi Robbins describes in her book, Creating More Effective Graphs (Robbins 2013), we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees. In other words, it is difficult for us to determine the relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another. Let’s examine the same data used in our previous barplot of the number of flights departing NYC by airline in Figure 2.21, but this time we will use a pie chart in Figure 2.22. Try to answer the following questions: How much smaller is the portion of the pie for Hawaiian Airlines Inc. (HA) compared to United Airlines (UA)? What is the third largest carrier in terms of departing flights? How many carriers have fewer flights than Delta Air Lines Inc. (DL)? FIGURE 2.22: The dreaded pie chart. While it is quite difficult to answer these questions when looking at the pie chart in Figure 2.22, we can much more easily answer these questions using the barchart in Figure 2.21. This is true since barplots present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories can be made with single horizontal lines, whereas pie charts present the information in a way such that comparisons must be made by comparing angles. Learning check (LC2.30) Why should pie charts be avoided and replaced by barplots? (LC2.31) Why do you think people continue to use pie charts? 2.8.3 Two categorical variables Barplots are a very common way to visualize the frequency of different categories, or levels, of a single categorical variable. Another use of barplots is to visualize the joint distribution of two categorical variables at the same time. Let’s examine the joint distribution of outgoing domestic flights from NYC by carrier as well as origin, in other words, the number of flights for each carrier and origin combination. This corresponds to the number of American Airlines flights from JFK, the number of American Airlines flights from LGA, the number of American Airlines flights from EWR, the number of Endeavor Air flights from JFK, and so on. Recall the ggplot() code that created the barplot of carrier frequency in Figure 2.21: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() We can now map the additional variable origin by adding a fill = origin inside the aes() aesthetic mapping. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 2.23: Stacked barplot of flight amount by carrier and origin. Figure 2.23 is an example of a stacked barplot. While simple to make, in certain aspects it is not ideal. For example, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors between the bars, corresponding to comparing the number of flights from each origin airport between the carriers. Before we continue, let’s address some common points of confusion among new R users. First, the fill aesthetic corresponds to the color used to fill the bars, while the color aesthetic corresponds to the color of the outline of the bars. This is identical to how we added color to our histogram in Subsection 2.5.1: we set the outline of the bars to white by setting color = \"white\" and the colors of the bars to blue steel by setting fill = \"steelblue\". Observe in Figure 2.24 that mapping origin to color and not fill yields grey bars with different colored outlines. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, color = origin)) + geom_bar() FIGURE 2.24: Stacked barplot with color aesthetic used instead of fill. Second, note that fill is another aesthetic mapping much like x-position; thus we were careful to include it within the parentheses of the aes() mapping. The following code, where the fill aesthetic is specified outside the aes() mapping will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new ggplot users make: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier), fill = origin) + geom_bar() An alternative to stacked barplots are side-by-side barplots, also known as dodged barplots, as seen in Figure 2.25. The code to create a side-by-side barplot is identical to the code to create a stacked barplot, but with a position = \"dodge\" argument added to geom_bar(). In other words, we are overriding the default barplot type, which is a stacked barplot, and specifying it to be a side-by-side barplot instead. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) FIGURE 2.25: Side-by-side barplot comparing number of flights by carrier and origin. Lastly, another type of barplot is a faceted barplot. Recall in Section 2.6 we visualized the distribution of hourly wind speeds at the 3 NYC airports split by month using facets. We apply the same principle to our barplot visualizing the frequency of carrier split by origin: instead of mapping origin to fill we include it as the variable to create small multiples of the plot across the levels of origin. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ origin, ncol = 1) FIGURE 2.26: Faceted barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and origin. Learning check (LC2.32) What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at Figure 2.23? (LC2.33) What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2023 in regards to the number of departing flights? (LC2.34) Why might the side-by-side barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case? (LC2.35) What are the disadvantages of using a dodged barplot, in general? (LC2.36) Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case? (LC2.37) What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot? 2.8.4 Summary Barplots are a common way of displaying the distribution of a categorical variable, or in other words the frequency with which the different categories (also called levels) occur. They are easy to understand and make it easy to make comparisons across levels. Furthermore, when trying to visualize the relationship of two categorical variables, you have many options: stacked barplots, side-by-side barplots, and faceted barplots. Depending on what aspect of the relationship you are trying to emphasize, you will need to make a choice between these three types of barplots and own that choice. 2.9 Conclusion 2.9.1 Summary table Let’s recap all five of the five named graphs (5NG) in Table 2.4 summarizing their differences. Using these 5NG, you’ll be able to visualize the distributions and relationships of variables contained in a wide array of datasets. This will be even more the case as we start to map more variables to more of each geometric object’s aesthetic attribute options, further unlocking the awesome power of the ggplot2 package. TABLE 2.4: Summary of Five Named Graphs Named graph Shows Geometric object Notes 1 Scatterplot Relationship between 2 numerical variables geom_point() 2 Linegraph Relationship between 2 numerical variables geom_line() Used when there is a sequential order to x-variable, e.g., time 3 Histogram Distribution of 1 numerical variable geom_histogram() Facetted histograms show the distribution of 1 numerical variable split by the values of another variable 4 Boxplot Distribution of 1 numerical variable split by the values of another variable geom_boxplot() 5 Barplot Distribution of 1 categorical variable geom_bar() when counts are not pre-counted, geom_col() when counts are pre-counted Stacked, side-by-side, and faceted barplots show the joint distribution of 2 categorical variables 2.9.2 Function argument specification Let’s go over some important points about specifying the arguments (i.e., inputs) to functions. Run the following two segments of code: # Segment 1: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() # Segment 2: ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() You’ll notice that both code segments create the same barplot, even though in the second segment we omitted the data = and mapping = code argument names. This is because the ggplot() function by default assumes that the data argument comes first and the mapping argument comes second. As long as you specify the data frame in question first and the aes() mapping second, you can omit the explicit statement of the argument names data = and mapping =. Going forward for the rest of this book, all ggplot() code will be like the second segment: with the data = and mapping = explicit naming of the argument omitted with the default ordering of arguments respected. We’ll do this for brevity’s sake; it’s common to see this style when reviewing other R users’ code. 2.9.3 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. If you want to further unlock the power of the ggplot2 package for data visualization, we suggest that you check out RStudio’s “Data Visualization with ggplot2” cheatsheet. This cheatsheet summarizes much more than what we’ve discussed in this chapter. In particular, it presents many more than the 5 geometric objects we covered in this chapter while providing quick and easy to read visual descriptions. For all the geometric objects, it also lists all the possible aesthetic attributes one can tweak. In the current version of RStudio in mid 2024, you can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -&gt; Help -&gt; Cheatsheets -&gt; “Data Visualization with ggplot2.” You can see a preview in the figure below. Alternatively, you can preview the cheat sheet by going to the ggplot2 Github page with this link. FIGURE 2.27: Data Visualization with ggplot2 cheatsheet. 2.9.4 What’s to come Recall in Figure 2.2 in Section 2.3 we visualized the relationship between departure delay and arrival delay for Envoy Air flights only, rather than all flights. This data is saved in the envoy_flights data frame from the moderndive package. In reality, the envoy_flights data frame is merely a subset of the flights data frame from the nycflights23 package consisting of all flights that left NYC in 2023. We created envoy_flights using the following code that uses the dplyr package for data wrangling: library(dplyr) envoy_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(carrier == &quot;MQ&quot;) ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point() This code takes the flights data frame and filter() it to only return the 357 rows where carrier is equal to \"MQ\", Envoy Air’s carrier code. (Recall from Section 1.2 that testing for equality is specified with == and not =.) The code then cycles back to save the output in a new data frame called envoy_flights using the &lt;- assignment operator. Similarly, recall in Figure 2.7 in Section 2.4 we visualized hourly wind speed recordings at Newark airport only for the first 15 days of January 2023. This data is saved in the early_january_2023_weather data frame from the moderndive package. In reality, the early_january_2023_weather data frame is merely a subset of the weather data frame from the nycflights23 package consisting of all hourly weather observations in 2023 for all three NYC airports. We created early_january_2023_weather using the following dplyr code: early_january_2023_weather &lt;- weather |&gt; filter(origin == &quot;EWR&quot; &amp; month == 1 &amp; day &lt;= 15) ggplot(data = early_january_2023_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_line() This code pares down the weather data frame to a new data frame early_january_2023_weather consisting of hourly wind speed recordings only for origin == \"EWR\", month == 1, and day less than or equal to 15. These two code segments are a preview of Chapter 3 on data wrangling using the dplyr package. Data wrangling is the process of transforming and modifying existing data with the intent of making it more appropriate for analysis purposes. For example, these two code segments used the filter() function to create new data frames (envoy_flights and early_january_2023_weather) by choosing only a subset of rows of existing data frames (flights and weather). In the next chapter, we’ll formally introduce the filter() and other data wrangling functions as well as the pipe operator |&gt; which allows you to combine multiple data wrangling actions into a single sequential chain of actions. On to Chapter 3 on data wrangling! References "],["3-wrangling.html", "Chapter 3 Data Wrangling 3.1 The pipe operator: |&gt; 3.2 filter rows 3.3 summarize variables 3.4 group_by rows 3.5 mutate existing variables 3.6 arrange and sort rows 3.7 join data frames 3.8 Other verbs 3.9 Conclusion", " Chapter 3 Data Wrangling So far in our journey, we’ve seen how to look at data saved in data frames using the glimpse() and View() functions in Chapter 1, and how to create data visualizations using the ggplot2 package in Chapter 2. In particular we studied what we term the “five named graphs” (5NG): scatterplots via geom_point() linegraphs via geom_line() boxplots via geom_boxplot() histograms via geom_histogram() barplots via geom_bar() or geom_col() We created these visualizations using the grammar of graphics, which maps variables in a data frame to the aesthetic attributes of one of the 5 geometric objects. We can also control other aesthetic attributes of the geometric objects such as the size and color as seen in the Gapminder data example in Figure 2.1. In this chapter, we’ll introduce a series of functions from the dplyr package for data wrangling that will allow you to take a data frame and “wrangle” it (transform it) to suit your needs. Such functions include: filter() a data frame’s existing rows to only pick out a subset of them. For example, the alaska_flights data frame. summarize() one or more of its columns/variables with a summary statistic. Examples of summary statistics include the median and interquartile range of temperatures as we saw in Section 2.7 on boxplots. group_by() its rows. In other words, assign different rows to be part of the same group. We can then combine group_by() with summarize() to report summary statistics for each group separately. For example, say you don’t want a single overall average departure delay dep_delay for all three origin airports combined, but rather three separate average departure delays, one computed for each of the three origin airports. mutate() its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, convert hourly temperature recordings from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. arrange() its rows. For example, sort the rows of weather in ascending or descending order of temp. join() it with another data frame by matching along a “key” variable. In other words, merge these two data frames together. Notice how we used computer_code font to describe the actions we want to take on our data frames. This is because the dplyr package for data wrangling has intuitively verb-named functions that are easy to remember. There is a further benefit to learning to use the dplyr package for data wrangling: its similarity to the database querying language SQL (pronounced “sequel” or spelled out as “S”, “Q”, “L”). SQL (which stands for “Structured Query Language”) is used to manage large databases quickly and efficiently and is widely used by many institutions with a lot of data. While SQL is a topic left for a book or a course on database management, keep in mind that once you learn dplyr, you can learn SQL easily. We’ll talk more about their similarities in Subsection 3.7.4. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(nycflights23) 3.1 The pipe operator: |&gt; Before we start data wrangling, let’s first introduce a nifty tool that has been a part of R since May 2021: the native pipe operator |&gt;. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in R into a single sequential chain of actions. In modern R, the native pipe operator |&gt; is now the default for chaining functions, replacing the previously common tidyverse pipe (%&gt;%) that was loaded with the dplyr package. Introduced in R 4.1.0 in May 2021, |&gt; offers a more intuitive and readable syntax for data wrangling and other tasks, eliminating the need for additional package dependencies. You’ll still often see R code using %&gt;% in older scripts or searches online, but we’ll use |&gt; in this book. The tidyverse pipe still works, so don’t worry if you see it in other code. Let’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h(): Take x then Use x as an input to a function f() then Use the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then Use the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h() One way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows: h(g(f(x))) This code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h() and each of the functions is short in its name. Further, each of these functions also only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. This is where the pipe operator |&gt; comes in handy. |&gt; takes the output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read |&gt; as “then” or “and then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows: x |&gt; f() |&gt; g() |&gt; h() You would read this sequence as: Take x then Use this output as the input to the next function f() then Use this output as the input to the next function g() then Use this output as the input to the next function h() So while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. But what are the hypothetical x, f(), g(), and h()? Throughout this chapter on data wrangling: The starting value x will be a data frame. For example, the flights data frame we explored in Section 1.4. The sequence of functions, here f(), g(), and h(), will mostly be a sequence of any number of the six data wrangling verb-named functions we listed in the introduction to this chapter. For example, the filter(carrier == \"MQ\") function and argument specified we previewed earlier. The result will be the transformed/modified data frame that you want. In our example, we’ll save the result in a new data frame by using the &lt;- assignment operator with the name alaska_flights via alaska_flights &lt;-. envoy_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;) Much like when adding layers to a ggplot() using the + sign, you form a single chain of data wrangling operations by combining verb-named functions into a single sequence using the pipe operator |&gt;. Furthermore, much like how the + sign has to come at the end of lines when constructing plots, the pipe operator |&gt; has to come at the end of lines as well. Keep in mind, there are many more advanced data wrangling functions than just the six listed in the introduction to this chapter; you’ll see some examples of these in Section 3.8. However, just with these six verb-named functions you’ll be able to perform a broad array of data wrangling tasks for the rest of this book. 3.2 filter rows FIGURE 3.1: Diagram of filter() rows operation. The filter() function here works much like the “Filter” option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variable in your dataset and then filters out only the rows that match that criteria. We begin by focusing only on flights from New York City to Phoenix, Arizona. The dest destination code (or airport code) for Phoenix, Arizona is \"PHX\". Run the following and look at the results in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer to ensure that only flights heading to Phoenix are chosen here: phoenix_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(dest == &quot;PHX&quot;) View(phoenix_flights) Note the order of the code. First, take the flights data frame flights then filter() the data frame so that only those where the dest equals \"PHX\" are included. We test for equality using the double equal sign == and not a single equal sign =. In other words, filter(dest = \"PHX\") will yield an error. This is a convention across many programming languages. If you are new to coding, you’ll probably forget to use the double equal sign == a few times before you get the hang of it. You can use other operators beyond just the == operator that tests for equality: &gt; corresponds to “greater than” &lt; corresponds to “less than” &gt;= corresponds to “greater than or equal to” &lt;= corresponds to “less than or equal to” != corresponds to “not equal to.” The ! is used in many programming languages to indicate “not.” Furthermore, you can combine multiple criteria using operators that make comparisons: | corresponds to “or” &amp; corresponds to “and” To see many of these in action, let’s filter flights for all rows that departed from JFK and were heading to Burlington, Vermont (\"BTV\") or Seattle, Washington (\"SEA\") and departed in the months of October, November, or December. Run the following: btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(origin == &quot;JFK&quot; &amp; (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;) &amp; month &gt;= 10) View(btv_sea_flights_fall) Note that even though colloquially speaking one might say “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont and Seattle, Washington,” in terms of computer operations, we really mean “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont or leaving Seattle, Washington.” For a given row in the data, dest can be \"BTV\", or \"SEA\", or something else, but not both \"BTV\" and \"SEA\" at the same time. Furthermore, note the careful use of parentheses around dest == \"BTV\" | dest == \"SEA\". We can often skip the use of &amp; and just separate our conditions with a comma. The previous code will return the identical output btv_sea_flights_fall as the following code: btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(origin == &quot;JFK&quot;, (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;), month &gt;= 10) View(btv_sea_flights_fall) Let’s present another example that uses the ! “not” operator to pick rows that don’t match a criteria. As mentioned earlier, the ! can be read as “not.” Here we are filtering rows corresponding to flights that didn’t go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA. not_BTV_SEA &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(!(dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;)) View(not_BTV_SEA) Again, note the careful use of parentheses around the (dest == \"BTV\" | dest == \"SEA\"). If we didn’t use parentheses as follows: flights |&gt; filter(!dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;) We would be returning all flights not headed to \"BTV\" or those headed to \"SEA\", which is an entirely different resulting data frame. Now say we have a larger number of airports we want to filter for, say \"SEA\", \"SFO\", \"PHX\", \"BTV\", and \"BDL\". We could continue to use the | (or) operator. many_airports &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(dest == &quot;SEA&quot; | dest == &quot;SFO&quot; | dest == &quot;PHX&quot; | dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;BDL&quot;) As we progressively include more airports, this will get unwieldy to write. A slightly shorter approach uses the %in% operator along with the c() function. Recall from Subsection 1.2.1 that the c() function “combines” or “concatenates” values into a single vector of values. many_airports &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(dest %in% c(&quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;PHX&quot;, &quot;BTV&quot;, &quot;BDL&quot;)) View(many_airports) What this code is doing is filtering flights for all flights where dest is in the vector of airports c(\"BTV\", \"SEA\", \"PHX\", \"SFO\", \"BDL\"). Both outputs of many_airports are the same, but as you can see the latter takes much less energy to code. The %in% operator is useful for looking for matches commonly in one vector/variable compared to another. As a final note, we recommend that filter() should often be among the first verbs you consider applying to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about, or put differently, it narrows down the scope of your data frame to just the observations you care about. Learning check (LC3.1) What’s another way of using the “not” operator ! to filter only the rows that are not going to Burlington, VT nor Seattle, WA in the flights data frame? Test this out using the previous code. 3.3 summarize variables The next common task when working with data frames is to compute summary statistics. Summary statistics are single numerical values that summarize a large number of values. Commonly known examples of summary statistics include the mean (also called the average) and the median (the middle value). Other examples of summary statistics that might not immediately come to mind include the sum, the smallest value also called the minimum, the largest value also called the maximum, and the standard deviation. See Appendix A.1 for a glossary of such summary statistics. Let’s calculate two summary statistics of the wind_speed temperature variable in the weather data frame: the mean and standard deviation (recall from Section 1.4 that the weather data frame is included in the nycflights23 package). To compute these summary statistics, we need the mean() and sd() summary functions in R. Summary functions in R take in many values and return a single value, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. FIGURE 3.2: Diagram illustrating a summary function in R. More precisely, we’ll use the mean() and sd() summary functions within the summarize() function from the dplyr package. Note you can also use the British English spelling of summarise(). As shown in Figure 3.3, the summarize() function takes in a data frame and returns a data frame with only one row corresponding to the summary statistics. FIGURE 3.3: Diagram of summarize() rows. We’ll save the results in a new data frame called summary_windspeed that will have two columns/variables: the mean and the std_dev: summary_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed), std_dev = sd(wind_speed)) summary_windspeed # A tibble: 1 × 2 mean std_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 NA NA Why are the values returned NA? NA is how R encodes missing values where NA indicates “not available” or “not applicable.” If a value for a particular row and a particular column does not exist, NA is stored instead. Values can be missing for many reasons. Perhaps the data was collected but someone forgot to enter it? Perhaps the data was not collected at all because it was too difficult to do so? Perhaps there was an erroneous value that someone entered that has been corrected to read as missing? You’ll often encounter issues with missing values when working with real data. Going back to our summary_windspeed output, by default any time you try to calculate a summary statistic of a variable that has one or more NA missing values in R, NA is returned. To work around this fact, you can set the na.rm argument to TRUE, where rm is short for “remove”; this will ignore any NA missing values and only return the summary value for all non-missing values. The code that follows computes the mean and standard deviation of all non-missing values of temp: summary_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_windspeed # A tibble: 1 × 2 mean std_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 9.44 5.26 Notice how the na.rm = TRUE are used as arguments to the mean() and sd() summary functions individually, and not to the summarize() function. However, one needs to be cautious whenever ignoring missing values as we’ve just done. In the upcoming Learning checks questions, we’ll consider the possible ramifications of blindly sweeping rows with missing values “under the rug.” This is in fact why the na.rm argument to any summary statistic function in R is set to FALSE by default. In other words, R does not ignore rows with missing values by default. R is alerting you to the presence of missing data and you should be mindful of this missingness and any potential causes of this missingness throughout your analysis. What are other summary functions we can use inside the summarize() verb to compute summary statistics? As seen in the diagram in Figure 3.2, you can use any function in R that takes many values and returns just one. Here are just a few: mean(): the average sd(): the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread min() and max(): the minimum and maximum values, respectively IQR(): interquartile range sum(): the total amount when adding multiple numbers n(): a count of the number of rows in each group. This particular summary function will make more sense when group_by() is covered in Section 3.4. Learning check (LC3.2) Say a doctor is studying the effect of smoking on lung cancer for a large number of patients who have records measured at five-year intervals. She notices that a large number of patients have missing data points because the patient has died, so she chooses to ignore these patients in her analysis. What is wrong with this doctor’s approach? (LC3.3) Modify the earlier summarize() function code that creates the summary_windspeed data frame to also use the n() summary function: summarize(... , count = n()). What does the returned value correspond to? (LC3.4) Why doesn’t the following code work? Run the code line-by-line instead of all at once, and then look at the data. In other words, select and then run summary_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) first. summary_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; summarize(std_dev = sd(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) 3.4 group_by rows FIGURE 3.4: Diagram of group_by() and summarize(). We can modify our code above to look at the average wind speed and its spread instead of wind speed too, keeping the na.rm = TRUE set just in case any missing values are stored in the temp column: summary_temp &lt;- weather |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_temp # A tibble: 1 × 2 mean std_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 9.44 5.26 Say instead of a single mean wind speed for the whole year, we would like 12 mean temperatures, one for each of the 12 months separately. In other words, we would like to compute the mean wind speed split by month. We can do this by “grouping” temperature observations by the values of another variable, in this case by the 12 values of the variable month: summary_monthly_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; group_by(month) |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_monthly_windspeed # A tibble: 12 × 3 month mean std_dev &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 10.3 6.01 2 2 10.9 6.57 3 3 12.3 6.33 4 4 10.0 5.03 5 5 8.89 4.46 6 6 8.53 4.43 7 7 7.98 4.35 8 8 8.85 4.34 9 9 8.92 4.66 10 10 8.23 4.69 11 11 9.50 4.84 12 12 8.77 5.02 This code is identical to the previous code that created summary_windspeed, but with an extra group_by(month) added before the summarize(). Grouping the weather dataset by month and then applying the summarize() functions yields a data frame that displays the mean and standard deviation wind speed split by the 12 months of the year. It is important to note that the group_by() function doesn’t change data frames by itself. Rather it changes the meta-data, or data about the data, specifically the grouping structure. It is only after we apply the summarize() function that the data frame changes. As another example, let’s consider the diamonds data frame included in the ggplot2 package. Run this code: diamonds # A tibble: 53,940 × 10 carat cut color clarity depth table price x y z &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.23 Ideal E SI2 61.5 55 326 3.95 3.98 2.43 2 0.21 Premium E SI1 59.8 61 326 3.89 3.84 2.31 3 0.23 Good E VS1 56.9 65 327 4.05 4.07 2.31 4 0.29 Premium I VS2 62.4 58 334 4.2 4.23 2.63 5 0.31 Good J SI2 63.3 58 335 4.34 4.35 2.75 6 0.24 Very Good J VVS2 62.8 57 336 3.94 3.96 2.48 7 0.24 Very Good I VVS1 62.3 57 336 3.95 3.98 2.47 8 0.26 Very Good H SI1 61.9 55 337 4.07 4.11 2.53 9 0.22 Fair E VS2 65.1 61 337 3.87 3.78 2.49 10 0.23 Very Good H VS1 59.4 61 338 4 4.05 2.39 # ℹ 53,930 more rows Observe that the first line of the output reads # A tibble: 53,940 x 10. This is an example of meta-data, in this case the number of observations/rows and variables/columns in diamonds. The actual data itself are the subsequent table of values. Now let’s pipe the diamonds data frame into group_by(cut): diamonds |&gt; group_by(cut) # A tibble: 53,940 × 10 # Groups: cut [5] carat cut color clarity depth table price x y z &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.23 Ideal E SI2 61.5 55 326 3.95 3.98 2.43 2 0.21 Premium E SI1 59.8 61 326 3.89 3.84 2.31 3 0.23 Good E VS1 56.9 65 327 4.05 4.07 2.31 4 0.29 Premium I VS2 62.4 58 334 4.2 4.23 2.63 5 0.31 Good J SI2 63.3 58 335 4.34 4.35 2.75 6 0.24 Very Good J VVS2 62.8 57 336 3.94 3.96 2.48 7 0.24 Very Good I VVS1 62.3 57 336 3.95 3.98 2.47 8 0.26 Very Good H SI1 61.9 55 337 4.07 4.11 2.53 9 0.22 Fair E VS2 65.1 61 337 3.87 3.78 2.49 10 0.23 Very Good H VS1 59.4 61 338 4 4.05 2.39 # ℹ 53,930 more rows Observe that now there is additional meta-data: # Groups: cut [5] indicating that the grouping structure meta-data has been set based on the 5 possible levels of the categorical variable cut: \"Fair\", \"Good\", \"Very Good\", \"Premium\", and \"Ideal\". On the other hand, observe that the data has not changed: it is still a table of 53,940 \\(\\times\\) 10 values. Only by combining a group_by() with another data wrangling operation, in this case summarize(), will the data actually be transformed. diamonds |&gt; group_by(cut) |&gt; summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) # A tibble: 5 × 2 cut avg_price &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Fair 4359. 2 Good 3929. 3 Very Good 3982. 4 Premium 4584. 5 Ideal 3458. If you would like to remove this grouping structure meta-data, we can pipe the resulting data frame into the ungroup() function: diamonds |&gt; group_by(cut) |&gt; ungroup() # A tibble: 53,940 × 10 carat cut color clarity depth table price x y z &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.23 Ideal E SI2 61.5 55 326 3.95 3.98 2.43 2 0.21 Premium E SI1 59.8 61 326 3.89 3.84 2.31 3 0.23 Good E VS1 56.9 65 327 4.05 4.07 2.31 4 0.29 Premium I VS2 62.4 58 334 4.2 4.23 2.63 5 0.31 Good J SI2 63.3 58 335 4.34 4.35 2.75 6 0.24 Very Good J VVS2 62.8 57 336 3.94 3.96 2.48 7 0.24 Very Good I VVS1 62.3 57 336 3.95 3.98 2.47 8 0.26 Very Good H SI1 61.9 55 337 4.07 4.11 2.53 9 0.22 Fair E VS2 65.1 61 337 3.87 3.78 2.49 10 0.23 Very Good H VS1 59.4 61 338 4 4.05 2.39 # ℹ 53,930 more rows Observe how the # Groups: cut [5] meta-data is no longer present. Let’s now revisit the n() counting summary function we briefly introduced previously. Recall that the n() function counts rows. This is opposed to the sum() summary function that returns the sum of a numerical variable. For example, suppose we’d like to count how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City: by_origin &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(origin) |&gt; summarize(count = n()) by_origin # A tibble: 3 × 2 origin count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 EWR 138578 2 JFK 133048 3 LGA 163726 We see that LaGuardia (\"LGA\") had the most flights departing in 2023 followed by Newark (\"EWR\") and lastly by \"JFK\". Note there is a subtle but important difference between sum() and n(); while sum() returns the sum of a numerical variable, n() returns a count of the number of rows/observations. Grouping by more than one variable You are not limited to grouping by one variable. Say you want to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports for each month. We can also group by a second variable month using group_by(origin, month): by_origin_monthly &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(origin, month) |&gt; summarize(count = n()) `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;origin&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. by_origin_monthly # A tibble: 36 × 3 # Groups: origin [3] origin month count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 EWR 1 11623 2 EWR 2 10991 3 EWR 3 12593 4 EWR 4 12022 5 EWR 5 12371 6 EWR 6 11339 7 EWR 7 11646 8 EWR 8 11561 9 EWR 9 11373 10 EWR 10 11805 # ℹ 26 more rows Note that an additional message appears here specifying the grouping done. The .groups argument to summarize() has four options: drop_last, drop, keep, and rowwise: drop_last drops the last grouping variable, drop drops all grouping variables, keep keeps all grouping variables, and rowwise turns each row into a group. In most circumstances that you’ll encounter, the default is drop_last which drops the last grouping variable. The message is informing us that the default behavior is to drop the last grouping variable, which in this case is month. Observe that there are 36 rows to by_origin_monthly because there are 12 months for 3 airports (EWR, JFK, and LGA). Why do we group_by(origin, month) and not group_by(origin) and then group_by(month)? Let’s investigate: by_origin_monthly_incorrect &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(origin) |&gt; group_by(month) |&gt; summarize(count = n()) by_origin_monthly_incorrect # A tibble: 12 × 2 month count &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 36020 2 2 34761 3 3 39514 4 4 37476 5 5 38710 6 6 35921 7 7 36211 8 8 36765 9 9 35505 10 10 36586 11 11 34521 12 12 33362 What happened here is that the second group_by(month) overwrote the grouping structure meta-data of the earlier group_by(origin), so that in the end we are only grouping by month. The lesson here is if you want to group_by() two or more variables, you should include all the variables at the same time in the same group_by() adding a comma between the variable names. Learning check (LC3.5) Recall from Chapter 2 when we looked at wind speeds by months in NYC. What does the standard deviation column in the summary_monthly_temp data frame tell us about temperatures in NYC throughout the year? (LC3.6) What code would be required to get the mean and standard deviation wind speed for each day in 2023 for NYC? (LC3.7) Recreate by_monthly_origin, but instead of grouping via group_by(origin, month), group variables in a different order group_by(month, origin). What differs in the resulting dataset? (LC3.8) How could we identify how many flights left each of the three airports for each carrier? (LC3.9) How does the filter() operation differ from a group_by() followed by a summarize()? 3.5 mutate existing variables FIGURE 3.5: Diagram of mutate() columns. Another common transformation of data is to create/compute new variables based on existing ones. For example, say you are more comfortable thinking of temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) instead of degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The formula to convert temperatures from °F to °C is \\[ \\text{temp in C} = \\frac{\\text{temp in F} - 32}{1.8} \\] We can apply this formula to the temp variable using the mutate() function from the dplyr package, which takes existing variables and mutates them to create new ones. weather &lt;- weather |&gt; mutate(temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8) In this code, we mutate() the weather data frame by creating a new variable temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8 and then overwrite the original weather data frame. Why did we overwrite the data frame weather, instead of assigning the result to a new data frame like weather_new? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing original information that you might need later, it’s acceptable practice to overwrite existing data frames with updated ones, as we did here. On the other hand, why did we not overwrite the variable temp, but instead created a new variable called temp_in_C? Because if we did this, we would have erased the original information contained in temp of temperatures in Fahrenheit that may still be valuable to us. Let’s now compute monthly average temperatures in both °F and °C using the group_by() and summarize() code we saw in Section 3.4: summary_monthly_temp &lt;- weather |&gt; group_by(month) |&gt; summarize(mean_temp_in_F = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), mean_temp_in_C = mean(temp_in_C, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_monthly_temp # A tibble: 12 × 3 month mean_temp_in_F mean_temp_in_C &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 35.7 2.04 2 2 34.5 1.39 3 3 45.0 7.24 4 4 54.6 12.6 5 5 53.6 12.0 6 6 69.2 20.6 7 7 78.4 25.8 8 8 72.8 22.7 9 9 64.7 18.1 10 10 64.2 17.9 11 11 47.5 8.64 12 12 45.9 7.72 Let’s consider another example. Passengers are often frustrated when their flight departs late, but aren’t as annoyed if, in the end, pilots can make up some time during the flight. This is known in the airline industry as gain, and we will create this variable using the mutate() function: flights &lt;- flights |&gt; mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay) Let’s take a look at only the dep_delay, arr_delay, and the resulting gain variables for the first 5 rows in our updated flights data frame in Table 3.1. TABLE 3.1: First five rows of departure/arrival delay and gain variables dep_delay arr_delay gain 203 205 -2 78 53 25 47 34 13 173 166 7 228 211 17 The flight in the first row departed 203 minutes late but arrived 205 minutes late, so its “gained time in the air” is a gain of -2 minutes, hence its gain is \\(203 - 205 = -2\\), which is a loss of 2 minutes. On the other hand, the flight in the third row departed late (dep_delay of 47) but arrived 34 minutes late (arr_delay of 34), so its “gained time in the air” is \\(47 - 34 = 13\\) minutes, hence its gain is 13. Let’s look at some summary statistics of the gain variable by considering multiple summary functions at once in the same summarize() code: gain_summary &lt;- flights |&gt; summarize( min = min(gain, na.rm = TRUE), q1 = quantile(gain, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), median = quantile(gain, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE), q3 = quantile(gain, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), max = max(gain, na.rm = TRUE), mean = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(gain, na.rm = TRUE), missing = sum(is.na(gain)) ) gain_summary # A tibble: 1 × 8 min q1 median q3 max mean sd missing &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 -321 1 11 20 101 9.35 18.4 12534 We see for example that the median gain is 11 minutes, while the largest is +101 minutes and the largest negative gain (or loss) at -321 minutes! However, this code would take some time to type out in practice. We’ll see later on in Subsection 5.1.1 that there is a much more succinct way to compute a variety of common summary statistics: using the skim() function from the skimr package. Recall from Section 2.5 that since gain is a numerical variable, we can visualize its distribution using a histogram. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = gain)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) FIGURE 3.6: Histogram of gain variable. The resulting histogram in Figure 3.6 provides additional perspective on the gain variable than the summary statistics we computed earlier. For example, note that most values of gain are right around 0. To close out our discussion on the mutate() function to create new variables, note that we can create multiple new variables at once in the same mutate() code. Furthermore, within the same mutate() code we can refer to new variables we just created. As an example, consider the mutate() code Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund show in Chapter 5 of R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2017): flights &lt;- flights |&gt; mutate( gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, hours = air_time / 60, gain_per_hour = gain / hours ) Learning check (LC3.10) What do positive values of the gain variable in flights correspond to? What about negative values? And what about a zero value? (LC3.11) Could we create the dep_delay and arr_delay columns by simply subtracting dep_time from sched_dep_time and similarly for arrivals? Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in flights. (LC3.12) What can we say about the distribution of gain? Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the gain_summary data frame values. 3.6 arrange and sort rows One of the most commonly performed data wrangling tasks is to sort a data frame’s rows in the alphanumeric order of one of the variables. The dplyr package’s arrange() function allows us to sort/reorder a data frame’s rows according to the values of the specified variable. Suppose we are interested in determining the most frequent destination airports for all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2023: freq_dest &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(dest) |&gt; summarize(num_flights = n()) freq_dest # A tibble: 118 × 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 ABQ 228 2 ACK 916 3 AGS 20 4 ALB 1581 5 ANC 95 6 ATL 17570 7 AUS 4848 8 AVL 1617 9 AVP 145 10 BDL 701 # ℹ 108 more rows Observe that by default the rows of the resulting freq_dest data frame are sorted in alphabetical order of destination. Say instead we would like to see the same data, but sorted from the most to the least number of flights (num_flights) instead: freq_dest |&gt; arrange(num_flights) # A tibble: 118 × 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 LEX 1 2 AGS 20 3 OGG 20 4 SBN 24 5 HDN 28 6 PNS 71 7 MTJ 77 8 ANC 95 9 VPS 109 10 AVP 145 # ℹ 108 more rows This is, however, the opposite of what we want. The rows are sorted with the least frequent destination airports displayed first. This is because arrange() always returns rows sorted in ascending order by default. To switch the ordering to be in “descending” order instead, we use the desc() function as so: freq_dest |&gt; arrange(desc(num_flights)) # A tibble: 118 × 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 BOS 19036 2 ORD 18200 3 MCO 17756 4 ATL 17570 5 MIA 16076 6 LAX 15968 7 FLL 14239 8 CLT 12866 9 DFW 11675 10 SFO 11651 # ℹ 108 more rows 3.7 join data frames Another common data transformation task is “joining” or “merging” two different datasets. For example, in the flights data frame, the variable carrier lists the carrier code for the different flights. While the corresponding airline names for \"UA\" and \"AA\" might be somewhat easy to guess (United and American Airlines), what airlines have codes \"VX\", \"HA\", and \"B6\"? This information is provided in a separate data frame airlines. View(airlines) We see that in airlines, carrier is the carrier code, while name is the full name of the airline company. Using this table, we can see that \"G4\", \"HA\", and \"B6\" correspond to Allegiant Air, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue, respectively. However, wouldn’t it be nice to have all this information in a single data frame instead of two separate data frames? We can do this by “joining” the flights and airlines data frames. Note that the values in the variable carrier in the flights data frame match the values in the variable carrier in the airlines data frame. In this case, we can use the variable carrier as a key variable to match the rows of the two data frames. Key variables are almost always identification variables that uniquely identify the observational units as we saw in Subsection 1.4.4. This ensures that rows in both data frames are appropriately matched during the join. Hadley and Garrett (Grolemund and Wickham 2017) created the diagram shown in Figure 3.7 to help us understand how the different data frames in the nycflights23 package are linked by various key variables: FIGURE 3.7: Data relationships in nycflights from R for Data Science. 3.7.1 Matching “key” variable names In both the flights and airlines data frames, the key variable we want to join/merge/match the rows by has the same name: carrier. Let’s use the inner_join() function to join the two data frames, where the rows will be matched by the variable carrier, and then compare the resulting data frames: flights_joined &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(flights) View(flights_joined) Observe that the flights and flights_joined data frames are identical except that flights_joined has an additional variable name. The values of name correspond to the airline companies’ names as indicated in the airlines data frame. A visual representation of the inner_join() is shown in Figure 3.8 (Grolemund and Wickham 2017). There are other types of joins available (such as left_join(), right_join(), outer_join(), and anti_join()), but the inner_join() will solve nearly all of the problems you’ll encounter in this book. FIGURE 3.8: Diagram of inner join from R for Data Science. 3.7.2 Different “key” variable names Say instead you are interested in the destinations of all domestic flights departing NYC in 2023, and you ask yourself questions like: “What cities are these airports in?”, or “Is \"ORD\" Orlando?”, or “Where is \"FLL\"?”. The airports data frame contains the airport codes for each airport: View(airports) However, if you look at both the airports and flights data frames, you’ll find that the airport codes are in variables that have different names. In airports the airport code is in faa, whereas in flights the airport codes are in origin and dest. This fact is further highlighted in the visual representation of the relationships between these data frames in Figure 3.7. In order to join these two data frames by airport code, our inner_join() operation will use the by = c(\"dest\" = \"faa\") argument with modified code syntax allowing us to join two data frames where the key variable has a different name: flights_with_airport_names &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) View(flights_with_airport_names) Let’s construct the chain of pipe operators |&gt; that computes the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also includes information about each destination airport: named_dests &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(dest) |&gt; summarize(num_flights = n()) |&gt; arrange(desc(num_flights)) |&gt; inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) |&gt; rename(airport_name = name) named_dests # A tibble: 114 × 9 dest num_flights airport_name lat lon alt tz dst tzone &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 BOS 19036 General Edward Lawren… 42.4 -71.0 20 -5 A Amer… 2 ORD 18200 Chicago O&#39;Hare Intern… 42.0 -87.9 672 -6 A Amer… 3 MCO 17756 Orlando International… 28.4 -81.3 96 -5 A Amer… 4 ATL 17570 Hartsfield Jackson At… 33.6 -84.4 1026 -5 A Amer… 5 MIA 16076 Miami International A… 25.8 -80.3 8 -5 A Amer… 6 LAX 15968 Los Angeles Internati… 33.9 -118. 125 -8 A Amer… 7 FLL 14239 Fort Lauderdale Holly… 26.1 -80.2 9 -5 A Amer… 8 CLT 12866 Charlotte Douglas Int… 35.2 -80.9 748 -5 A Amer… 9 DFW 11675 Dallas Fort Worth Int… 32.9 -97.0 607 -6 A Amer… 10 SFO 11651 San Francisco Interna… 37.6 -122. 13 -8 A Amer… # ℹ 104 more rows In case you didn’t know, \"ORD\" is the airport code of Chicago O’Hare airport and \"FLL\" is the main airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which can be seen in the airport_name variable. 3.7.3 Multiple “key” variables Say instead we want to join two data frames by multiple key variables. For example, in Figure 3.7, we see that in order to join the flights and weather data frames, we need more than one key variable: year, month, day, hour, and origin. This is because the combination of these 5 variables act to uniquely identify each observational unit in the weather data frame: hourly weather recordings at each of the 3 NYC airports. We achieve this by specifying a vector of key variables to join by using the c() function. Recall from Subsection 1.2.1 that c() is short for “combine” or “concatenate.” flights_weather_joined &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(weather, by = c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;origin&quot;)) View(flights_weather_joined) Learning check (LC3.13) Looking at Figure 3.7, when joining flights and weather (or, in other words, matching the hourly weather values with each flight), why do we need to join by all of year, month, day, hour, and origin, and not just hour? (LC3.14) What surprises you about the top 10 destinations from NYC in 2023? 3.7.4 Normal forms The data frames included in the nycflights23 package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data. For example, the flights data frame only saves the carrier code of the airline company; it does not include the actual name of the airline. For example, you’ll see that the first row of flights has carrier equal to UA, but it does not include the airline name of “United Air Lines Inc.” The names of the airline companies are included in the name variable of the airlines data frame. In order to have the airline company name included in flights, we could join these two data frames as follows: joined_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(joined_flights) We are capable of performing this join because each of the data frames have keys in common to relate one to another: the carrier variable in both the flights and airlines data frames. The key variable(s) that we base our joins on are often identification variables as we mentioned previously. This is an important property of what’s known as normal forms of data. The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called normalization. More information is available on Wikipedia. Both dplyr and SQL we mentioned in the introduction of this chapter use such normal forms. Given that they share such commonalities, once you learn either of these two tools, you can learn the other very easily. Learning check (LC3.15) What are some advantages of data in normal forms? What are some disadvantages? 3.8 Other verbs Here are some other useful data wrangling verbs: select() only a subset of variables/columns. relocate() variables/columns to a new position. rename() variables/columns to have new names. Return only the top_n() values of a variable. 3.8.1 select variables FIGURE 3.9: Diagram of select() columns. We’ve seen that the flights data frame in the nycflights23 package contains 19 different variables. You can identify the names of these 19 variables by running the glimpse() function from the dplyr package: glimpse(flights) However, say you only need two of these 19 variables, say carrier and flight. You can select() these two variables: flights |&gt; select(carrier, flight) This function makes it easier to explore large datasets since it allows us to limit the scope to only those variables we care most about. For example, if we select() only a smaller number of variables as is shown in Figure 3.9, it will make viewing the dataset in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer more digestible. Let’s say instead you want to drop, or de-select, certain variables. For example, consider the variable year in the flights data frame. This variable isn’t quite a “variable” because it is always 2023 and hence doesn’t change. Say you want to remove this variable from the data frame. We can deselect year by using the - sign: flights_no_year &lt;- flights |&gt; select(-year) Another way of selecting columns/variables is by specifying a range of columns: flight_arr_times &lt;- flights |&gt; select(month:day, arr_time:sched_arr_time) flight_arr_times This will select() all columns between month and day, as well as between arr_time and sched_arr_time, and drop the rest. The helper functions starts_with(), ends_with(), and contains() can be used to select variables/columns that match those conditions. As examples, flights |&gt; select(starts_with(&quot;a&quot;)) flights |&gt; select(ends_with(&quot;delay&quot;)) flights |&gt; select(contains(&quot;time&quot;)) Lastly, the select() function can also be used to reorder columns when used with the everything() helper function. For example, suppose we want the hour, minute, and time_hour variables to appear immediately after the year, month, and day variables, while not discarding the rest of the variables. In the following code, everything() will pick up all remaining variables: flights_reorder &lt;- flights |&gt; select(year, month, day, hour, minute, time_hour, everything()) glimpse(flights_reorder) 3.8.2 relocate variables Another (usually shorter) way to reorder variables is by using the relocate() function. This function allows you to move variables to a new position in the data frame. For example, if we want to move the hour, minute, and time_hour variables to appear immediately after the year, month, and day variables, we can use the following code: flights_relocate &lt;- flights |&gt; relocate(hour, minute, time_hour, .after = day) glimpse(flights_relocate) 3.8.3 rename variables One more useful function is rename(), which as you may have guessed changes the name of variables. Suppose we want to only focus on dep_time and arr_time and change dep_time and arr_time to be departure_time and arrival_time instead in the flights_time data frame: flights_time_new &lt;- flights |&gt; select(dep_time, arr_time) |&gt; rename(departure_time = dep_time, arrival_time = arr_time) glimpse(flights_time_new) Note that in this case we used a single = sign within the rename(). For example, departure_time = dep_time renames the dep_time variable to have the new name departure_time. This is because we are not testing for equality like we would using ==. Instead we want to assign a new variable departure_time to have the same values as dep_time and then delete the variable dep_time. Note that new dplyr users often forget that the new variable name comes before the equal sign. 3.8.4 top_n values of a variable We can also return the top n values of a variable using the top_n() function. For example, we can return a data frame of the top 10 destination airports using the example from Subsection 3.7.2. Observe that we set the number of values to return to n = 10 and wt = num_flights to indicate that we want the rows corresponding to the top 10 values of num_flights. See the help file for top_n() by running ?top_n for more information. named_dests |&gt; top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) Let’s further arrange() these results in descending order of num_flights: named_dests |&gt; top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) |&gt; arrange(desc(num_flights)) Learning check (LC3.16) What are some ways to select all three of the dest, air_time, and distance variables from flights? Give the code showing how to do this in at least three different ways. (LC3.17) How could one use starts_with(), ends_with(), and contains() to select columns from the flights data frame? Provide three different examples in total: one for starts_with(), one for ends_with(), and one for contains(). (LC3.18) Why might we want to use the select() function on a data frame? (LC3.19) Create a new data frame that shows the top 5 airports with the largest arrival delays from NYC in 2023. 3.9 Conclusion 3.9.1 Summary table Let’s recap our data wrangling verbs in Table 3.2. Using these verbs and the pipe |&gt; operator from Section 3.1, you’ll be able to write easily legible code to perform almost all the data wrangling and data transformation necessary for the rest of this book. TABLE 3.2: Summary of data wrangling verbs Verb Data wrangling operation filter() Pick out a subset of rows summarize() Summarize many values to one using a summary statistic function like mean(), median(), etc. group_by() Add grouping structure to rows in data frame. Note this does not change values in data frame, rather only the meta-data mutate() Create new variables by mutating existing ones arrange() Arrange rows of a data variable in ascending (default) or descending order inner_join() Join/merge two data frames, matching rows by a key variable Learning check (LC3.20) Let’s now put your newly acquired data wrangling skills to the test! An airline industry measure of a passenger airline’s capacity is the available seat miles, which is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometers flown summed over all flights. For example, let’s consider the scenario in Figure 3.10. Since the airplane has 4 seats and it travels 200 miles, the available seat miles are \\(4 \\times 200 = 800\\). FIGURE 3.10: Example of available seat miles for one flight. Extending this idea, let’s say an airline had 2 flights using a plane with 10 seats that flew 500 miles and 3 flights using a plane with 20 seats that flew 1000 miles, the available seat miles would be \\(2 \\times 10 \\times 500 + 3 \\times 20 \\times 1000 = 70,000\\) seat miles. Using the datasets included in the nycflights23 package, compute the available seat miles for each airline sorted in descending order. After completing all the necessary data wrangling steps, the resulting data frame should have 16 rows (one for each airline) and 2 columns (airline name and available seat miles). Here are some hints: Crucial: Unless you are very confident in what you are doing, it is worthwhile not starting to code right away. Rather, first sketch out on paper all the necessary data wrangling steps not using exact code, but rather high-level pseudocode that is informal yet detailed enough to articulate what you are doing. This way you won’t confuse what you are trying to do (the algorithm) with how you are going to do it (writing dplyr code). Take a close look at all the datasets using the View() function: flights, weather, planes, airports, and airlines to identify which variables are necessary to compute available seat miles. Figure 3.7 showing how the various datasets can be joined will also be useful. Consider the data wrangling verbs in Table 3.2 as your toolbox! 3.9.2 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. In the online Appendix C, we provide a page of data wrangling “tips and tricks” consisting of the most common data wrangling questions we’ve encountered in student projects (shout out to Dr. Jenny Smetzer for her work setting this up!): Dealing with missing values Reordering bars in a barplot Showing money on an axis Changing values inside cells Converting a numerical variable to a categorical one Computing proportions Dealing with %, commas, and $ However, to provide a tips and tricks page covering all possible data wrangling questions would be too long to be useful! If you want to further unlock the power of the dplyr package for data wrangling, we suggest that you check out RStudio’s “Data Transformation with dplyr” cheatsheet. This cheatsheet summarizes much more than what we’ve discussed in this chapter, in particular more intermediate level and advanced data wrangling functions, while providing quick and easy-to-read visual descriptions. In fact, many of the diagrams illustrating data wrangling operations in this chapter, such as Figure 3.1 on filter(), originate from this cheatsheet. In the current version of RStudio in late 2019, you can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -&gt; Help -&gt; Cheatsheets -&gt; “Data Transformation with dplyr.” You can see a preview in the figure below. FIGURE 3.11: Data Transformation with dplyr cheatsheet. On top of the data wrangling verbs and examples we presented in this section, if you’d like to see more examples of using the dplyr package for data wrangling, check out Chapter 5 of R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2017). 3.9.3 What’s to come? So far in this book, we’ve explored, visualized, and wrangled data saved in data frames. These data frames were saved in a spreadsheet-like format: in a rectangular shape with a certain number of rows corresponding to observations and a certain number of columns corresponding to variables describing these observations. We’ll see in the upcoming Chapter 4 that there are actually two ways to represent data in spreadsheet-type rectangular format: (1) “wide” format and (2) “tall/narrow” format. The tall/narrow format is also known as “tidy” format in R user circles. While the distinction between “tidy” and non-“tidy” formatted data is subtle, it has immense implications for our data science work. This is because almost all the packages used in this book, including the ggplot2 package for data visualization and the dplyr package for data wrangling, all assume that all data frames are in “tidy” format. Furthermore, up until now we’ve only explored, visualized, and wrangled data saved within R packages. But what if you want to analyze data that you have saved in a Microsoft Excel, a Google Sheets, or a “Comma-Separated Values” (CSV) file? In Section 4.1, we’ll show you how to import this data into R using the readr package. References "],["4-tidy.html", "Chapter 4 Data Importing and “Tidy” Data 4.1 Importing data 4.2 “Tidy” data 4.3 Case study: Democracy in Guatemala 4.4 tidyverse package 4.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 4 Data Importing and “Tidy” Data In Subsection 1.2.1, we introduced the concept of a data frame in R: a rectangular spreadsheet-like representation of data where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables describing each observation. In Section 1.4, we started exploring our first data frame: the flights data frame included in the nycflights23 package. In Chapter 2, we created visualizations based on the data included in flights and other data frames such as weather. In Chapter 3, we learned how to take existing data frames and transform/modify them to suit our ends. In this final chapter of the “Data Science with tidyverse” portion of the book, we extend some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called “tidy” data. You will see that having data stored in “tidy” format is about more than just what the everyday definition of the term “tidy” might suggest: having your data “neatly organized.” Instead, we define the term “tidy” as it’s used by data scientists who use R, outlining a set of rules by which data is saved. Knowledge of this type of data formatting was not necessary for our treatment of data visualization in Chapter 2 and data wrangling in Chapter 3. This is because all the data used were already in “tidy” format. In this chapter, we’ll now see that this format is essential to using the tools we covered up until now. Furthermore, it will also be useful for all subsequent chapters in this book when we cover regression and statistical inference. First, however, we’ll show you how to import spreadsheet data in R. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(nycflights23) library(fivethirtyeight) 4.1 Importing data Up to this point, we’ve almost entirely used data stored inside of an R package. Say instead you have your own data saved on your computer or somewhere online. How can you analyze this data in R? Spreadsheet data is often saved in one of the following three formats: First, a Comma Separated Values .csv file. You can think of a .csv file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where: Each line in the file corresponds to one row of data/one observation. Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas in each row. The first line is often, but not always, a header row indicating the names of the columns/variables. Second, an Excel .xlsx spreadsheet file. This format is based on Microsoft’s proprietary Excel software. As opposed to bare-bones .csv files, .xlsx Excel files contain a lot of meta-data (data about data). Recall we saw a previous example of meta-data in Section 3.4 when adding “group structure” meta-data to a data frame by using the group_by() verb. Some examples of Excel spreadsheet meta-data include the use of bold and italic fonts, colored cells, different column widths, and formula macros. Third, a Google Sheets file, which is a “cloud” or online-based way to work with a spreadsheet. Google Sheets allows you to download your data in both comma separated values .csv and Excel .xlsx formats. One way to import Google Sheets data in R is to go to the Google Sheets menu bar -&gt; File -&gt; Download as -&gt; Select “Microsoft Excel” or “Comma-separated values” and then load that data into R. A more advanced way to import Google Sheets data in R is by using the googlesheets4 package, a method we leave to a more advanced data science book. We’ll cover two methods for importing .csv and .xlsx spreadsheet data in R: one using the console and the other using RStudio’s graphical user interface, abbreviated as “GUI.” 4.1.1 Using the console First, let’s import a Comma Separated Values .csv file that exists on the internet. The .csv file dem_score.csv contains ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992 and is accessible at https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv. Let’s use the read_csv() function from the readr (Wickham, Hester, and Bryan 2024) package to read it off the web, import it into R, and save it in a data frame called dem_score. library(readr) dem_score &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv&quot;) dem_score # A tibble: 96 × 10 country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982` `1987` `1992` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Albania -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 5 2 Argentina -9 -1 -1 -9 -9 -9 -8 8 7 3 Armenia -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 7 4 Australia 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 5 Austria 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 6 Azerbaijan -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 1 7 Belarus -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 7 8 Belgium 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 Bhutan -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 10 Bolivia -4 -3 -3 -4 -7 -7 8 9 9 # ℹ 86 more rows In this dem_score data frame, the minimum value of -10 corresponds to a highly autocratic nation, whereas a value of 10 corresponds to a highly democratic nation. Note also that backticks surround the different variable names. Variable names in R by default are not allowed to start with a number nor include spaces, but we can get around this fact by surrounding the column name with backticks. We’ll revisit the dem_score data frame in a case study in the upcoming Section 4.3. Note that the read_csv() function included in the readr package is different than the read.csv() function that comes installed with R. While the difference in the names might seem trivial (an _ instead of a .), the read_csv() function is, in our opinion, easier to use since it can more easily read data off the web and generally imports data at a much faster speed. Furthermore, the read_csv() function included in the readr saves data frames as tibbles by default. 4.1.2 Using RStudio’s interface Let’s read in the exact same data, but this time from an Excel file saved on your computer. Furthermore, we’ll do this using RStudio’s graphical interface instead of running read_csv() in the console. First, download the Excel file dem_score.xlsx by going to https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.xlsx, then Go to the Files pane of RStudio. Navigate to the directory (i.e., folder on your computer) where the downloaded dem_score.xlsx Excel file is saved. For example, this might be in your Downloads folder. Click on dem_score.xlsx. Click “Import Dataset…” At this point, you should see a screen pop-up like in Figure 4.1. After clicking on the “Import” button on the bottom right of Figure 4.1, RStudio will save this spreadsheet’s data in a data frame called dem_score and display its contents in the spreadsheet viewer. FIGURE 4.1: Importing an Excel file to R. Furthermore, note the “Code Preview” block in the bottom right of Figure 4.1. You can copy and paste this code to reload your data again later programmatically, instead of repeating this manual point-and-click process. 4.2 “Tidy” data Let’s now switch gears and learn about the concept of “tidy” data format with a motivating example from the fivethirtyeight package. The fivethirtyeight package (Kim, Ismay, and Chunn 2021) provides access to the datasets used in many articles published by the data journalism website, FiveThirtyEight.com. For a complete list of all 128 datasets included in the fivethirtyeight package, check out the package webpage by going to: https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/articles/fivethirtyeight.html. Let’s focus our attention on the drinks data frame and look at its first 5 rows: # A tibble: 5 × 5 country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure…¹ &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 0 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 # ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​total_litres_of_pure_alcohol After reading the help file by running ?drinks, you’ll see that drinks is a data frame containing results from a survey of the average number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed in 193 countries. This data was originally reported on FiveThirtyEight.com in Mona Chalabi’s article: “Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?”. Let’s apply some of the data wrangling verbs we learned in Chapter 3 on the drinks data frame: filter() the drinks data frame to only consider 4 countries: the United States, China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, then select() all columns except total_litres_of_pure_alcohol by using the - sign, then rename() the variables beer_servings, spirit_servings, and wine_servings to beer, spirit, and wine, respectively. and save the resulting data frame in drinks_smaller: drinks_smaller &lt;- drinks |&gt; filter(country %in% c(&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;, &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot;)) |&gt; select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) |&gt; rename(beer = beer_servings, spirit = spirit_servings, wine = wine_servings) drinks_smaller # A tibble: 4 × 4 country beer spirit wine &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China 79 192 8 2 Italy 85 42 237 3 Saudi Arabia 0 5 0 4 USA 249 158 84 Let’s now ask ourselves a question: “Using the drinks_smaller data frame, how would we create the side-by-side barplot in Figure 4.2?”. Recall we saw barplots displaying two categorical variables in Subsection 2.8.3. FIGURE 4.2: Comparing alcohol consumption in 4 countries. Let’s break down the grammar of graphics we introduced in Section 2.1: The categorical variable country with four levels (China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, USA) would have to be mapped to the x-position of the bars. The numerical variable servings would have to be mapped to the y-position of the bars (the height of the bars). The categorical variable type with three levels (beer, spirit, wine) would have to be mapped to the fill color of the bars. Observe that drinks_smaller has three separate variables beer, spirit, and wine. In order to use the ggplot() function to recreate the barplot in Figure 4.2 however, we need a single variable type with three possible values: beer, spirit, and wine. We could then map this type variable to the fill aesthetic of our plot. In other words, to recreate the barplot in Figure 4.2, our data frame would have to look like this: drinks_smaller_tidy # A tibble: 12 × 3 country type servings &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China beer 79 2 Italy beer 85 3 Saudi Arabia beer 0 4 USA beer 249 5 China spirit 192 6 Italy spirit 42 7 Saudi Arabia spirit 5 8 USA spirit 158 9 China wine 8 10 Italy wine 237 11 Saudi Arabia wine 0 12 USA wine 84 Observe that while drinks_smaller and drinks_smaller_tidy are both rectangular in shape and contain the same 12 numerical values (3 alcohol types by 4 countries), they are formatted differently. drinks_smaller is formatted in what’s known as “wide” format, whereas drinks_smaller_tidy is formatted in what’s known as “long/narrow” format. In the context of doing data science in R, long/narrow format is also known as “tidy” format. In order to use the ggplot2 and dplyr packages for data visualization and data wrangling, your input data frames must be in “tidy” format. Thus, all non-“tidy” data must be converted to “tidy” format first. Before we convert non-“tidy” data frames like drinks_smaller to “tidy” data frames like drinks_smaller_tidy, let’s define “tidy” data. 4.2.1 Definition of “tidy” data You have surely heard the word “tidy” in your life: “Tidy up your room!” “Write your homework in a tidy way so it is easier to provide feedback.” Marie Kondo’s best-selling book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing, and Netflix TV series Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. “I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - ‘Read me, please!’” - Linda Grant What does it mean for your data to be “tidy”? While “tidy” has a clear English meaning of “organized,” the word “tidy” in data science using R means that your data follows a standardized format. We will follow Hadley Wickham’s definition of “tidy” data (Wickham 2014) shown also in Figure 4.3: A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings AKA text data (if qualitative/categorical). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes. “Tidy” data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table. FIGURE 4.3: Tidy data graphic from R for Data Science. For example, say you have the following table of stock prices in Table 4.1: TABLE 4.1: Stock prices (non-tidy format) Date Boeing stock price Amazon stock price Google stock price 2009-01-01 $173.55 $174.90 $174.34 2009-01-02 $172.61 $171.42 $170.04 Although the data are neatly organized in a rectangular spreadsheet-type format, they do not follow the definition of data in “tidy” format. While there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (date, stock name, and stock price), there are not three columns. In “tidy” data format, each variable should be its own column, as shown in Table 4.2. Notice that both tables present the same information, but in different formats. TABLE 4.2: Stock prices (tidy format) Date Stock Name Stock Price 2009-01-01 Boeing $173.55 2009-01-01 Amazon $174.90 2009-01-01 Google $174.34 2009-01-02 Boeing $172.61 2009-01-02 Amazon $171.42 2009-01-02 Google $170.04 Now we have the requisite three columns Date, Stock Name, and Stock Price. On the other hand, consider the data in Table 4.3. TABLE 4.3: Example of tidy data Date Boeing Price Weather 2009-01-01 $173.55 Sunny 2009-01-02 $172.61 Overcast In this case, even though the variable “Boeing Price” occurs just like in our non-“tidy” data in Table 4.1, the data is “tidy” since there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information: Date, Boeing price, and the Weather that particular day. Learning check (LC4.1) What are common characteristics of “tidy” data frames? (LC4.2) What makes “tidy” data frames useful for organizing data? 4.2.2 Converting to “tidy” data In this book so far, you’ve only seen data frames that were already in “tidy” format. Furthermore, for the rest of this book, you’ll mostly only see data frames that are already in “tidy” format as well. This is not always the case however with all datasets in the world. If your original data frame is in wide (non-“tidy”) format and you would like to use the ggplot2 or dplyr packages, you will first have to convert it to “tidy” format. To do so, we recommend using the pivot_longer() function in the tidyr package (Wickham, Vaughan, and Girlich 2024). Going back to our drinks_smaller data frame from earlier: drinks_smaller # A tibble: 4 × 4 country beer spirit wine &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China 79 192 8 2 Italy 85 42 237 3 Saudi Arabia 0 5 0 4 USA 249 158 84 We convert it to “tidy” format by using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package as follows: drinks_smaller_tidy &lt;- drinks_smaller |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;type&quot;, values_to = &quot;servings&quot;, cols = -country) drinks_smaller_tidy # A tibble: 12 × 3 country type servings &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China beer 79 2 China spirit 192 3 China wine 8 4 Italy beer 85 5 Italy spirit 42 6 Italy wine 237 7 Saudi Arabia beer 0 8 Saudi Arabia spirit 5 9 Saudi Arabia wine 0 10 USA beer 249 11 USA spirit 158 12 USA wine 84 We set the arguments to pivot_longer() as follows: names_to here corresponds to the name of the variable in the new “tidy”/long data frame that will contain the column names of the original data. Observe how we set names_to = \"type\". In the resulting drinks_smaller_tidy, the column type contains the three types of alcohol beer, spirit, and wine. Since type is a variable name that doesn’t appear in drinks_smaller, we use quotation marks around it. You’ll receive an error if you just use names_to = type here. values_to here is the name of the variable in the new “tidy” data frame that will contain the values of the original data. Observe how we set values_to = \"servings\" since each of the numeric values in each of the beer, wine, and spirit columns of the drinks_smaller data corresponds to a value of servings. In the resulting drinks_smaller_tidy, the column servings contains the 4 \\(\\times\\) 3 = 12 numerical values. Note again that servings doesn’t appear as a variable in drinks_smaller so it again needs quotation marks around it for the values_to argument. The third argument cols is the columns in the drinks_smaller data frame you either want to or don’t want to “tidy.” Observe how we set this to -country indicating that we don’t want to “tidy” the country variable in drinks_smaller and rather only beer, spirit, and wine. Since country is a column that appears in drinks_smaller we don’t put quotation marks around it. The third argument here of cols is a little nuanced, so let’s consider code that’s written slightly differently but that produces the same output: drinks_smaller |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;type&quot;, values_to = &quot;servings&quot;, cols = c(beer, spirit, wine)) Note that the third argument now specifies which columns we want to “tidy” with c(beer, spirit, wine), instead of the columns we don’t want to “tidy” using -country. We use the c() function to create a vector of the columns in drinks_smaller that we’d like to “tidy.” Note that since these three columns appear one after another in the drinks_smaller data frame, we could also do the following for the cols argument: drinks_smaller |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;type&quot;, values_to = &quot;servings&quot;, cols = beer:wine) With our drinks_smaller_tidy “tidy” formatted data frame, we can now produce the barplot you saw in Figure 4.2 using geom_col(). This is done in Figure 4.4. Recall from Section 2.8 on barplots that we use geom_col() and not geom_bar(), since we would like to map the “pre-counted” servings variable to the y-aesthetic of the bars. ggplot(drinks_smaller_tidy, aes(x = country, y = servings, fill = type)) + geom_col(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) FIGURE 4.4: Comparing alcohol consumption in 4 countries using geom_col(). Converting “wide” format data to “tidy” format often confuses new R users. The only way to learn to get comfortable with the pivot_longer() function is with practice, practice, and more practice using different datasets. For example, run ?pivot_longer and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file. We’ll show another example of using pivot_longer() to convert a “wide” formatted data frame to “tidy” format in Section 4.3. If however you want to convert a “tidy” data frame to “wide” format, you will need to use the pivot_wider() function instead. Run ?pivot_wider and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file for examples. You can also view examples of both pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() on the tidyverse.org webpage. There’s a nice example to check out the different functions available for data tidying and a case study using data from the World Health Organization on that webpage. Furthermore, each week the R4DS Online Learning Community posts a dataset in the weekly #TidyTuesday event that might serve as a nice place for you to find other data to explore and transform. Learning check (LC4.3) Take a look at the airline_safety data frame included in the fivethirtyeight data package. Run the following: airline_safety After reading the help file by running ?airline_safety, we see that airline_safety is a data frame containing information on different airline companies’ safety records. This data was originally reported on the data journalism website, FiveThirtyEight.com, in Nate Silver’s article, “Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?”. Let’s only consider the variables airline and those relating to fatalities for simplicity: airline_safety_smaller &lt;- airline_safety |&gt; select(airline, starts_with(&quot;fatalities&quot;)) airline_safety_smaller # A tibble: 56 × 3 airline fatalities_85_99 fatalities_00_14 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 Aer Lingus 0 0 2 Aeroflot 128 88 3 Aerolineas Argentinas 0 0 4 Aeromexico 64 0 5 Air Canada 0 0 6 Air France 79 337 7 Air India 329 158 8 Air New Zealand 0 7 9 Alaska Airlines 0 88 10 Alitalia 50 0 # ℹ 46 more rows This data frame is not in “tidy” format. How would you convert this data frame to be in “tidy” format, in particular so that it has a variable fatalities_years indicating the incident year and a variable count of the fatality counts? 4.2.3 nycflights23 package Recall the nycflights23 package we introduced in Section 1.4 with data about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2023. Let’s revisit the flights data frame by running View(flights). We saw that flights has a rectangular shape, with each of its 435,352 rows corresponding to a flight and each of its 22 columns corresponding to different characteristics/measurements of each flight. This satisfied the first two criteria of the definition of “tidy” data from Subsection 4.2.1: that “Each variable forms a column” and “Each observation forms a row.” But what about the third property of “tidy” data that “Each type of observational unit forms a table”? Recall that we saw in Subsection 1.4.3 that the observational unit for the flights data frame is an individual flight. In other words, the rows of the flights data frame refer to characteristics/measurements of individual flights. Also included in the nycflights23 package are other data frames with their rows representing different observational units (Ismay, Couch, and Wickham 2024): airlines: translation between two letter IATA carrier codes and airline company names (14 in total). The observational unit is an airline company. planes: aircraft information about each of 4,840 planes used, i.e., the observational unit is an aircraft. weather: hourly meteorological data (about 8,735 observations) for each of the three NYC airports, i.e., the observational unit is an hourly measurement of weather at one of the three airports. airports: airport names and locations. The observational unit is an airport. The organization of the information into these five data frames follows the third “tidy” data property: observations corresponding to the same observational unit should be saved in the same table, i.e., data frame. You could think of this property as the old English expression: “birds of a feather flock together.” 4.3 Case study: Democracy in Guatemala In this section, we’ll show you another example of how to convert a data frame that isn’t in “tidy” format (“wide” format) to a data frame that is in “tidy” format (“long/narrow” format). We’ll do this using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package again. Furthermore, we’ll make use of functions from the ggplot2 and dplyr packages to produce a time-series plot showing how the democracy scores have changed over the 40 years from 1952 to 1992 for Guatemala. Recall that we saw time-series plots in Section 2.4 on creating linegraphs using geom_line(). Let’s use the dem_score data frame we imported in Section 4.1, but focus on only data corresponding to Guatemala. guat_dem &lt;- dem_score |&gt; filter(country == &quot;Guatemala&quot;) guat_dem # A tibble: 1 × 10 country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982` `1987` `1992` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Guatemala 2 -6 -5 3 1 -3 -7 3 3 Let’s lay out the grammar of graphics we saw in Section 2.1. First we know we need to set data = guat_dem and use a geom_line() layer, but what is the aesthetic mapping of variables? We’d like to see how the democracy score has changed over the years, so we need to map: year to the x-position aesthetic and democracy_score to the y-position aesthetic Now we are stuck in a predicament, much like with our drinks_smaller example in Section 4.2. We see that we have a variable named country, but its only value is \"Guatemala\". We have other variables denoted by different year values. Unfortunately, the guat_dem data frame is not “tidy” and hence is not in the appropriate format to apply the grammar of graphics, and thus we cannot use the ggplot2 package just yet. We need to take the values of the columns corresponding to years in guat_dem and convert them into a new “names” variable called year. Furthermore, we need to take the democracy score values in the inside of the data frame and turn them into a new “values” variable called democracy_score. Our resulting data frame will have three columns: country, year, and democracy_score. Recall that the pivot_longer() function in the tidyr package does this for us: guat_dem_tidy &lt;- guat_dem |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;year&quot;, values_to = &quot;democracy_score&quot;, cols = -country, names_transform = list(year = as.integer)) guat_dem_tidy # A tibble: 9 × 3 country year democracy_score &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Guatemala 1952 2 2 Guatemala 1957 -6 3 Guatemala 1962 -5 4 Guatemala 1967 3 5 Guatemala 1972 1 6 Guatemala 1977 -3 7 Guatemala 1982 -7 8 Guatemala 1987 3 9 Guatemala 1992 3 We set the arguments to pivot_longer() as follows: names_to is the name of the variable in the new “tidy” data frame that will contain the column names of the original data. Observe how we set names_to = \"year\". In the resulting guat_dem_tidy, the column year contains the years where Guatemala’s democracy scores were measured. values_to is the name of the variable in the new “tidy” data frame that will contain the values of the original data. Observe how we set values_to = \"democracy_score\". In the resulting guat_dem_tidy the column democracy_score contains the 1 \\(\\times\\) 9 = 9 democracy scores as numeric values. The third argument is the columns you either want to or don’t want to “tidy.” Observe how we set this to cols = -country indicating that we don’t want to “tidy” the country variable in guat_dem and rather only variables 1952 through 1992. The last argument of names_transform tells R what type of variable year should be set to. Without specifying that it is an integer as we’ve done here, pivot_longer() will set it to be a character value by default. We can now create the time-series plot in Figure 4.5 to visualize how democracy scores in Guatemala have changed from 1952 to 1992 using a geom_line(). Furthermore, we’ll use the labs() function in the ggplot2 package to add informative labels to all the aes()thetic attributes of our plot, in this case the x and y positions. ggplot(guat_dem_tidy, aes(x = year, y = democracy_score)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Democracy Score&quot;) FIGURE 4.5: Democracy scores in Guatemala 1952-1992. Note that if we forgot to include the names_transform argument specifying that year was not of character format, we would have gotten an error here since geom_line() wouldn’t have known how to sort the character values in year in the right order. Learning check (LC4.4) Convert the dem_score data frame into a “tidy” data frame and assign the name of dem_score_tidy to the resulting long-formatted data frame. (LC4.5) Read in the life expectancy data stored at https://moderndive.com/data/le_mess.csv and convert it to a “tidy” data frame. 4.4 tidyverse package Notice at the beginning of the chapter we loaded the following four packages, which are among four of the most frequently used R packages for data science: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(readr) library(tidyr) Recall that ggplot2 is for data visualization, dplyr is for data wrangling, readr is for importing spreadsheet data into R, and tidyr is for converting data to “tidy” format. There is a much quicker way to load these packages than by individually loading them: by installing and loading the tidyverse package. The tidyverse package acts as an “umbrella” package whereby installing/loading it will install/load multiple packages at once for you. After installing the tidyverse package as you would a normal package as seen in Section 1.3, running: library(tidyverse) would be the same as running: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(purrr) library(tibble) library(stringr) library(forcats) The purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats are left for a more advanced book; check out R for Data Science to learn about these packages. For the remainder of this book, we’ll start every chapter by running library(tidyverse), instead of loading the various component packages individually. The tidyverse “umbrella” package gets its name from the fact that all the functions in all its packages are designed to have common inputs and outputs: data frames are in “tidy” format. This standardization of input and output data frames makes transitions between different functions in the different packages as seamless as possible. For more information, check out the tidyverse.org webpage for the package. 4.5 Conclusion 4.5.1 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. If you want to learn more about using the readr and tidyr package, we suggest that you check out RStudio’s “Data Import Cheat Sheet.” In the current version of RStudio in mid 2024, you can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -&gt; Help -&gt; Cheat Sheets -&gt; “Browse Cheat Sheets…” -&gt; Scroll down the page to the “Data import with reader, readxl, and googlesheets4…” for information on using the readr, readxl and googlesheets4 packages to import data, and the “Data tidying with tidyr cheatsheet” for information on using the tidyr package to “tidy” data. You can see a preview of both cheatsheets in the figures below. FIGURE 4.6: Data Import cheatsheet (first page): readr package. FIGURE 4.7: Data Import cheatsheet (second page): tidyr package. 4.5.2 What’s to come? Congratulations! You’ve completed the “Data Science with tidyverse” portion of this book. We’ll now move to the “Statistical modeling with moderndive” portion of this book in Chapters 5 and 6, where you’ll leverage your data visualization and wrangling skills to model relationships between different variables in data frames. However, we’re going to leave Chapter 10 on “Inference for Regression” until after we’ve covered statistical inference in Chapters 7, 8, and 9. Onwards and upwards into Statistical/Data Modeling as shown in Figure 4.8! FIGURE 4.8: ModernDive flowchart - on to Part II! References "],["5-regression.html", "Chapter 5 Simple Linear Regression 5.1 One numerical explanatory variable 5.2 One categorical explanatory variable 5.3 Related topics 5.4 Conclusion", " Chapter 5 Simple Linear Regression We have introduced data visualization in Chapter 2, data wrangling in Chapter 3, and data importing and “tidy” data in Chapter 4. In this chapter we work with regression, a method that helps us study the relationship between an outcome variable or response and one or more explanatory variables or regressors. The method starts by proposing a statistical model. Data is then collected and used to estimate the coefficients or parameters for the model, and these results are typically used for two purposes: For explanation when we want to describe how changes in one or more of the regressors are associated to changes in the response, quantify those changes, establish which of the regressors truly have an association with the response, or determine whether the model used to describe the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables seems appropriate. For prediction when we want to determine, based on the observed values of the regressors what will the value of the response before this value has been observed. We are not concerned about how all the regressors relate and interact with one another or with the response, we simply want as good predictions as possible. As an illustration, assume that we want to study the relationship between blood pressure and potential risk factors such as daily salt intake, age, and physical activity levels. The response is blood pressure, and the regressors are the risk factors. If we use linear regression for explanation, we may want to determine whether reducing daily salt intake has a real effect on lowering blood pressure, or by how much blood pressure decreases if an individual reduces their salt intake by half. This information may help target individuals of a specific age group with advice on dietary changes to manage blood pressure. On the other hand, if we use linear regression for prediction, we would like to determine, as accurately as possible, the blood pressure of a given individual based on the data collected about their salt intake, age, and physical activity levels. In this chapter, we will use linear regression for explanation. The most basic and commonly-used type of regression is linear regression. Linear regression involves a numerical response and one or more regressors that can be numerical or categorical. It is called linear regression because the statistical model that describes the relationship between the expected response and the regressors is assumed to be linear. In particular, when the model has a single regressor, the linear regression is the equation of a line. Linear regression is the foundation for almost any other type of regression or related method. In Chapter 5 we introduce linear regression with only one regressor. In Section 5.1, the explanatory variable is numerical. This scenario is known as simple linear regression. In Section 5.2, the explanatory variable is categorical. In Chapter 6 on multiple regression, we extend these ideas and work with models with two explanatory variables. In Section 6.1, we work with two numerical explanatory variables. In Section 6.2, we work with one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable and study model with and without interactions. In Chapter 10 on inference for regression, we revisit the regression models and analyze the results using statistical inference, a method discussed in Chapters 7, 8, and 9 on sampling, bootstrapping and confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing and \\(p\\)-values, respectively. The focus there is also be on using linear regression for prediction instead of explanation. We begin with regression with a single explanatory variable, . We also introduce the correlation coefficient, discuss about “correlation versus causation,” and determine whether the model fits the data observed. Needed packages We now load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). In this chapter, we introduce some new packages: The tidyverse “umbrella” (Wickham 2023) package. Recall from our discussion in Section 4.4 that loading the tidyverse package by running library(tidyverse) loads the following commonly used data science packages all at once: ggplot2 for data visualization dplyr for data wrangling tidyr for converting data to “tidy” format readr for importing spreadsheet data into R As well as the more advanced purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats packages The moderndive package of datasets and functions for tidyverse-friendly introductory linear regression as well as a data frame summary function. If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) 5.1 One numerical explanatory variable Before we introduce the model needed for simple linear regression, we present an example. Why do some countries exhibit high fertility rates while others have significantly lower ones? Are there correlations between fertility rates and life expectancy across different continents and nations? Could underlying socioeconomic factors be influencing these trends? These are all questions that are of interest to demographers and policy makers, as understanding fertility rates is important for planning and development. By analyzing the data set of UN member states, which includes variables such as country codes (ISO), fertility rates, and life expectancy for 2022, researchers can uncover patterns and make predictions about fertility rates based on life expectancy. In this section, we aim to explain differences in fertility rates as a function of one numerical variable: life expectancy. Could it be that countries with higher life expectancy also have lower fertility rates? Could it be instead that countries with higher life expectancy tend to have higher fertility rates? Or could it be that there is no relationship between life expectancy and fertility rates? We answer these questions by modeling the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy using simple linear regression , where we have: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) (the country’s fertility rate) and A single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) (the country’s life expectancy). 5.1.1 Exploratory data analysis The data on the 193 current UN member states (as of 2024) can be found in the un_member_states_2024 data frame included in the moderndive package. However, to keep things simple we include only those rows that don’t have missing data with na.omit() and select() only the subset of the variables we’ll consider in this chapter, and save this data in a new data frame called UN_data_ch5: UN_data_ch5 &lt;- un_member_states_2024 |&gt; select(iso, life_exp = life_expectancy_2022, fert_rate = fertility_rate_2022, obes_rate = obesity_rate_2016)|&gt; na.omit() A crucial step before doing any kind of analysis or modeling is performing an exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short. EDA gives you a sense of the distributions of the individual variables in your data, whether any potential relationships exist between variables, whether there are outliers and/or missing values, and (most importantly) how to build your model. Here are three common steps in an EDA: Most crucially, looking at the raw data values. Computing summary statistics, such as means, medians, and interquartile ranges. Creating data visualizations. We perform the first common step in an exploratory data analysis: looking at the raw data values. Because this step seems so trivial, unfortunately many data analysts ignore it. However, getting an early sense of what your raw data looks like can often prevent many larger issues down the road. You can do this by using RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using the glimpse() function as introduced in Subsection 1.4.3 on exploring data frames: glimpse(UN_data_ch5) Rows: 181 Columns: 4 $ iso &lt;chr&gt; &quot;AFG&quot;, &quot;ALB&quot;, &quot;DZA&quot;, &quot;AGO&quot;, &quot;ATG&quot;, &quot;ARG&quot;, &quot;ARM&quot;, &quot;AUS&quot;, &quot;AUT… $ life_exp &lt;dbl&gt; 53.6, 79.5, 78.0, 62.1, 77.8, 78.3, 76.1, 83.1, 82.3, 74.2, … $ fert_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 4.3, 1.4, 2.7, 5.0, 1.6, 1.9, 1.6, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.8, … $ obes_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 5.5, 21.7, 27.4, 8.2, 18.9, 28.3, 20.2, 29.0, 20.1, 19.9, 31… Observe that Rows: 181 indicates that there are 181 rows/observations in UN_data_ch5 after filtering out the missing values, where each row corresponds to one observed country/member state. It is important to note that the observational unit is an individual country. Recall from Subsection 1.4.3 that the observational unit is the “type of thing” that is being measured by our variables. A full description of all the variables included in un_member_states_2024 can be found by reading the associated help file (run ?un_member_states_2024 in the console). However, we fully describe only the 4 variables we selected in UN_data_ch5: iso: An identification variable used to distinguish between the 181 countries in the filtered dataset. fert_rate: A numerical variable representing the country’s fertility rate in 2022 corresponding to the expected number of children born per woman in child-bearing years. This is the outcome variable \\(y\\) of interest. life_exp: A numerical variable representing the country’s average life expectancy in 2022 in years. This is the primary explanatory variable \\(x\\) of interest. obes_rate: A numerical variable representing the country’s obesity rate in 2016. This will be another explanatory variable \\(x\\) that we use in the Learning check at the end of this subsection. An alternative way to look at the raw data values is by choosing a random sample of the rows in UN_data_ch5 by piping it into the slice_sample() function from the dplyr package. Here we set the n argument to be 5, indicating that we want a random sample of 5 rows. We display the results in Table 5.1. Note that due to the random nature of the sampling, you will likely end up with a different subset of 5 rows. UN_data_ch5 |&gt; slice_sample(n = 5) TABLE 5.1: A random sample of 5 out of the 193 total countries (181 without missing data) iso life_exp fert_rate obes_rate PRT 81.5 1.4 20.8 MNE 77.8 1.7 23.3 CPV 73.8 1.9 11.8 VNM 75.5 1.9 2.1 IDN 73.1 2.1 6.9 We have looked at the raw values in our UN_data_ch5 data frame and got a preliminary sense of the data. We can now compute summary statistics. We start by computing the mean and median of our numerical outcome variable fert_rate and our numerical explanatory variable life_exp. We do this by using the summarize() function from dplyr along with the mean() and median() summary functions we saw in Section 3.3. UN_data_ch5 |&gt; summarize(mean_life_exp = mean(life_exp), mean_fert_rate = mean(fert_rate), median_life_exp = median(life_exp), median_fert_rate = median(fert_rate)) # A tibble: 1 × 4 mean_life_exp mean_fert_rate median_life_exp median_fert_rate &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 73.6 2.50 75.1 2 However, what if we want other summary statistics as well, such as the standard deviation (a measure of spread), the minimum and maximum values, and various percentiles? Typing out all these summary statistic functions in summarize() would be long and tedious. Instead, we use the convenient tidy_summary() function from the moderndive package. This function takes in a data frame, summarizes it, and returns commonly used summary statistics in tidy format. We take our UN_data_ch5 data frame, select() only the outcome and explanatory variables fert_rate and life_exp, and pipe them into the tidy_summary function: UN_data_ch5 |&gt; select(fert_rate, life_exp) |&gt; tidy_summary() # A tibble: 2 × 11 column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 fert_rate 181 &lt;NA&gt; numeric 1.1 1.6 2.50 2 3.2 6.6 1.15 2 life_exp 181 &lt;NA&gt; numeric 53.6 69.4 73.6 75.1 78.3 86.4 6.80 We can also do this more directly by providing which columns we’d like a summary of inside the tidy_summary() function: UN_data_ch5 |&gt; tidy_summary(columns = c(fert_rate, life_exp)) # A tibble: 2 × 11 column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 fert_rate 181 &lt;NA&gt; numeric 1.1 1.6 2.50 2 3.2 6.6 1.15 2 life_exp 181 &lt;NA&gt; numeric 53.6 69.4 73.6 75.1 78.3 86.4 6.80 Both styles of code return the same results. For the numerical variables fert_rate and life_exp it returns: column: the name of the column being summarized n: the number of non-missing values group: NA (missing) for numerical columns, but will break down a categorical variable into its levels type: which type of column is it (numeric, character, factor, or logical) min: the minimum value Q1: the 1st quartile: the value at which 25% of observations are smaller than it (the 25th percentile) mean: the average value for measuring central tendency median: the 2nd quartile: the value at which 50% of observations are smaller than it (the 50th percentile) Q3: the 3rd quartile: the value at which 75% of observations are smaller than it (the 75th percentile) max: the maximum value sd: the standard deviation value for measuring spread Looking at this output, we can see how the values of both variables distribute. For example, the median fertility rate was 2, whereas the median life expectancy was 75.14 years. Furthermore, the middle 50% of fertility rates was between 1.6 and 3.2 (the first and third quartiles), whereas the middle 50% of life expectancies falls within 69.36 to 78.31. The tidy_summary() function only returns what are known as univariate summary statistics: functions that take a single variable and return some numerical summary of that variable. However, there also exist bivariate summary statistics: functions that take in two variables and return some summary of those two variables. In particular, when the two variables are numerical, we can compute the correlation coefficient. Generally speaking, coefficients are quantitative expressions of a specific phenomenon. A correlation coefficient is a quantitative expression of the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. Its value ranges between -1 and 1 where: -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship: As one variable increases, the value of the other variable tends to go down, following a straight line. 0 indicates no relationship: The values of both variables go up/down independently of each other. +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship: As the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go up as well in a linear fashion. Figure 5.1 gives examples of 9 different correlation coefficient values for hypothetical numerical variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For example, observe in the top right plot that for a correlation coefficient of -0.75 there is a negative linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), but it is not as strong as the negative linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when the correlation coefficient is -0.9 or -1. FIGURE 5.1: Nine different correlation coefficients. The correlation coefficient can be computed using the get_correlation() function in the moderndive package. In this case, the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables for which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. We put the name of the outcome variable on the left-hand side of the ~ “tilde” sign, while putting the name of the explanatory variable on the right-hand side. This is known as R’s formula notation. We will use this same “formula” syntax with regression later in this chapter. UN_data_ch5 |&gt; get_correlation(formula = fert_rate ~ life_exp) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.812 An alternative way to compute correlation is to use the cor() summary function within a summarize(): UN_data_ch5 |&gt; summarize(correlation = cor(fert_rate, life_exp)) In our case, the correlation coefficient of -0.812 indicates that the relationship between fertility rate and life expectancy is “moderately negative.” There is a certain amount of subjectivity in interpreting correlation coefficients, especially those that are not close to the extreme values of -1, 0, and 1. To develop your intuition about correlation coefficients, play the “Guess the Correlation” 1980’s style video game mentioned in Subsection 5.4.1. We now perform the last step in EDA: creating data visualizations. Since both the fert_rate and life_exp variables are numerical, a scatterplot is an appropriate graph to visualize this data. We do this using geom_point() and display the result in Figure 5.2. Furthermore, we set the alpha value to 0.1 to check for any overplotting. ggplot(UN_data_ch5, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + labs(x = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;) FIGURE 5.2: Scatterplot of relationship of life expectancy and fertility rate We do not see much for overplotting due to little to no overlap in the points. Most life expectancy entries appear to fall between 70 and 80 years, while most fertility rate entries fall between 1.5 and 3.5 births. Furthermore, while opinions may vary, it is our opinion that the relationship between fertility rate and life expectancy is “moderately negative.” This is consistent with our earlier computed correlation coefficient of -0.812. We build on the scatterplot in Figure 5.2 by adding a “best-fitting” line: of all possible lines we can draw on this scatterplot, it is the line that “best” fits through the cloud of points. We do this by adding a new geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) layer to the ggplot() code that created the scatterplot in Figure 5.2. The method = \"lm\" argument sets the line to be a “linear model.” The se = FALSE argument suppresses standard error uncertainty bars. (We’ll define the concept of standard error later in Subsection ??.) ggplot(UN_data_ch5, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + labs( x = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;, title = &quot;Scatterplot of relationship of life expectancy and fertility rate&quot; ) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 5.3: Regression line. The line in the resulting Figure 5.3 is called a “regression line.” The regression line is a visual summary of the relationship between two numerical variables, in our case the outcome variable fert_rate and the explanatory variable life_exp. The negative slope of the blue line is consistent with our earlier observed correlation coefficient of -0.812 suggesting that there is a negative relationship between these two variables: as a country’s population has higher life expectancy it tends to have a lower fertility rate. We’ll see later, however, that while the correlation coefficient and the slope of a regression line always have the same sign (positive or negative), they typically do not have the same value. Furthermore, a regression line is “best-fitting” in that it minimizes some mathematical criteria. We present these mathematical criteria in Subsection 5.3.2, but we suggest you read this subsection only after first reading the rest of this section on regression with one numerical explanatory variable. Learning check (LC5.1) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same outcome variable \\(y\\) being fert_rate but with obes_rate as the new explanatory variable \\(x\\). Remember, this involves three things: Looking at the raw data values. Computing summary statistics. Creating data visualizations. What can you say about the relationship between obesity rate and fertility rate based on this exploration? 5.1.2 Simple linear regression You may recall from secondary/high school algebra that the equation of a line is \\(y = a + b\\cdot x\\). (Note that the \\(\\cdot\\) symbol is equivalent to the \\(\\times\\) “multiply by” mathematical symbol. We’ll use the \\(\\cdot\\) symbol in the rest of this book as it is more succinct.) It is defined by two coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The intercept coefficient \\(a\\) is the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\). The slope coefficient \\(b\\) for \\(x\\) is the increase in \\(y\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). This is also called the “rise over run.” However, when defining a regression line like the regression line in Figure 5.3, we use slightly different notation: the equation of the regression line is \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\) . The intercept coefficient is \\(b_0\\), so \\(b_0\\) is the value of \\(\\widehat{y}\\) when \\(x = 0\\). The slope coefficient for \\(x\\) is \\(b_1\\), i.e., the increase in \\(\\widehat{y}\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). Why do we put a “hat” on top of the \\(y\\)? It’s a form of notation commonly used in regression to indicate that we have a “fitted value,” or the value of \\(y\\) on the regression line for a given \\(x\\) value. We discuss this more in the upcoming Subsection 5.1.3. We know that the regression line in Figure 5.3 has a negative slope \\(b_1\\) corresponding to our explanatory \\(x\\) variable life_exp. Why? Because as countries tend to have higher life_exp values, they tend to have lower fert_rate values. However, what is the numerical value of the slope \\(b_1\\)? What about the intercept \\(b_0\\)? We not compute these two values by hand, but rather we use a computer! We can obtain the values of the intercept \\(b_0\\) and the slope for life_exp \\(b_1\\) by outputting the linear regression coefficients. This is done in two steps: We first “fit” the linear regression model using the lm() function and save it in demographics_model. We get the regression coefficients by applying coef() to demographics_model. # Fit regression model: demographics_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp, data = UN_data_ch5) # Get regression coefficients coef(demographics_model) We first focus on interpreting the regression coefficients, and later revisit the code that produced it. The coefficients are the intercept \\(b_0 = 12.599\\) and the slope \\(b_1 = -0.137\\) for life_exp. Thus the equation of the regression line in Figure 5.3 follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\\\ \\widehat{\\text{fertility}\\_\\text{rate}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy}} \\cdot \\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy}\\\\ &amp;= 12.6 + -0.137 \\cdot \\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy} \\end{aligned} \\] The intercept \\(b_0\\) = 12.599 is the average fertility rate \\(\\widehat{y}\\) = \\(\\widehat{\\text{fertility}\\_\\text{rate}}\\) for those countries that had a life_exp of 0. Or in graphical terms, where the line intersects the \\(y\\) axis for \\(x\\) = 0. Note, however, that while the intercept of the regression line has a mathematical interpretation, it has no practical interpretation here, since observing a life_exp of 0 is impossible. Furthermore, looking at the scatterplot with the regression line in Figure 5.3, no countries had a life expectancy anywhere near 0. Of greater interest is the slope \\(b_1\\) = \\(b_{\\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy}}\\) for life_exp of -0.137. This summarizes the relationship between the fertility rate and life expectancy variables. Note that the sign is negative, suggesting a negative relationship between these two variables. This means countries with higher life expectancies tend to have lower fertility rates. Recall from earlier that the correlation coefficient is -0.812. They both have the same negative sign, but have a different value. Recall further that the correlation’s interpretation is the “strength of linear association”. The slope’s interpretation is a little different: For every increase of 1 unit in life_exp, there is an associated decrease of, on average, 0.137 units of fert_rate. We only state that there is an associated increase and not necessarily a causal increase. For example, perhaps it may not be that higher life expectancies directly cause lower fertility rates. Instead, the following could hold true: wealthier countries tend to have stronger educational backgrounds, improved health, a higher standard of living, and have lower fertility rates, while at the same time these wealthy countries also tend to have higher life expectancies. In other words, just because two variables are strongly associated, it does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. This is summed up in the often quoted phrase, “correlation is not necessarily causation.” We discuss this idea further in Subsection 5.3.1. Furthermore, we say that this associated decrease is on average 0.137 units of fert_rate, because you might have two countries whose life_exp values differ by 1 unit, but their difference in fertility rates may not be exactly \\(-0.137\\). What the slope of \\(-0.137\\) is saying is that across all possible countries, the average difference in fertility rate between two countries whose life expectancies differ by one is \\(-0.137\\). Now that we have learned how to compute the equation for the regression line in Figure 5.3 using the model coefficient values and how to interpret the resulting intercept and slope, we revisit the code that generated these coefficients: # Fit regression model: demographics_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp, data = UN_data_ch5) # Get regression coefficients: coef(demographics_model) First, we “fit” the linear regression model to the data using the lm() function and save this as demographics_model. When we say “fit”, we mean “find the best fitting line to this data.” lm() stands for “linear model” and is used as follows: lm(y ~ x, data = data_frame_name) where: y is the outcome variable, followed by a tilde ~. In our case, y is set to fert_rate. x is the explanatory variable. In our case, x is set to life_exp. The combination of y ~ x is called a model formula. (Note the order of y and x.) In our case, the model formula is fert_rate ~ life_exp. We saw such model formulas earlier when we computed the correlation coefficient using the get_correlation() function in Subsection 5.1.1. data_frame_name is the name of the data frame that contains the variables y and x. In our case, data is the UN_data_ch5 data frame. Second, we take the saved model in demographics_model and apply the coef() function to it to obtain the regression coefficients. This gives us the components of the regression equation line: the intercept \\(b_0\\) and the slope \\(b_1\\). Learning check (LC5.2) Fit a new simple linear regression using lm(fert_rate ~ obes_rate, data = UN_data_ch5) where obes_rate is the new explanatory variable \\(x\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression coefficients by applying the coef() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your earlier exploratory data analysis? 5.1.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals We just saw how to get the value of the intercept and the slope of a regression line from the output of the coef() function. Now instead say we want information on individual observations. For example, we focus on the 21st of the 181 countries in the UN_data_ch5 data frame in Table 5.2. This corresponds to the UN member state of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH). TABLE 5.2: Data for the 21st country out of 193 iso life_exp fert_rate obes_rate BIH 78 1.3 17.9 What is the value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) on the regression line corresponding to this country’s life_exp value of 77.98? In Figure 5.4 we mark three values corresponding to these results for Bosnia and Herzegovina and give their statistical names: Circle: The observed value \\(y\\) = 1.3 is this country’s actual fertility rate. Square: The fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) is the value on the regression line for \\(x\\) = life_exp = 77.98. This value is computed using the intercept and slope in the previous regression table: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x = 12.599 + -0.137 \\cdot 77.98 = 1.894\\] Arrow: The length of this arrow is the residual and is computed by subtracting the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) from the observed value \\(y\\). The residual can be thought of as a model’s error or “lack of fit” for a particular observation. In the case of this country, it is \\(y - \\widehat{y} = 1.3 - 1.894 = -0.594\\). FIGURE 5.4: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual. Now say we want to compute both the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\) and the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) for all 181 UN member states with complete data as of 2024. Recall that each country corresponds to one of the 181 rows in the UN_data_ch5 data frame and also one of the 181 points in the regression plot in Figure 5.4. We could repeat the previous calculations we performed by hand 181 times, but that would be tedious and time consuming. Instead, we do this using a computer with the get_regression_points() function. We apply the get_regression_points() function to demographics_model, which is where we saved our lm() model in the previous section. In Table 5.3 we present the results of only the 21st through 24th courses for brevity’s sake. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(demographics_model) regression_points TABLE 5.3: Regression points (for only the 21st through 24th countries) ID fert_rate life_exp fert_rate_hat residual 21 1.3 78.0 1.89 -0.594 22 2.7 65.6 3.59 -0.888 23 1.6 75.9 2.18 -0.576 24 1.7 80.6 1.53 0.165 This function is an example of what is known in computer programming as a wrapper function. It takes other pre-existing functions and “wraps” them into a single function that hides its inner workings. This concept is illustrated in Figure 5.5. FIGURE 5.5: The concept of a wrapper function. So all you need to worry about is what the inputs look like and what the outputs look like; you leave all the other details “under the hood of the car.” In our regression modeling example, the get_regression_points() function takes a saved lm() linear regression model as input and returns a data frame of the regression predictions as output. If you are interested in learning more about the get_regression_points() function’s inner workings, check out Subsection 5.3.3. We inspect the individual columns and match them with the elements of Figure 5.4: The fert_rate column represents the observed outcome variable \\(y\\). This is the y-position of the 181 black points. The life_exp column represents the values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). This is the x-position of the 181 black points. The fert_rate_hat column represents the fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\). This is the corresponding value on the regression line for the 181 \\(x\\) values. The residual column represents the residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\). This is the 181 vertical distances between the 181 black points and the regression line. Just as we did for the 21st country in the UN_data_ch5 dataset (in the first row of the table), we repeat the calculations for the 24th country (in the fourth row of Table 5.3). This corresponds to the country of Brunei (BRN): fert_rate \\(= 1.7\\) is the observed fert_rate \\(y\\) for this country. life_exp \\(= 80.59\\) is the value of the explanatory variable life_exp \\(x\\) for Brunei. fert_rate_hat \\(= 1.53 = 12.599 + (-0.137) \\cdot 80.59\\) is the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) on the regression line for this country. residual \\(= 0.165 = 1.7 - 1.53\\) is the value of the residual for this country. In other words, the model’s fitted value was off by 0.165 fertility rate units for Brunei. At this point, you can skip ahead if you like to Subsection 5.3.2 to learn about the processes behind what makes “best-fitting” regression lines. As a primer, a “best-fitting” line refers to the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals out of all possible lines we can draw through the points. In Section 5.2, we’ll discuss another common scenario of having a categorical explanatory variable and a numerical outcome variable. Learning check (LC5.3) Generate a data frame of the residuals of the model where you used obesity_rate_2024 as the explanatory \\(x\\) variable. 5.2 One categorical explanatory variable It is an unfortunate truth that life expectancy is not the same across all countries in the world. International development agencies are interested in studying these differences in life expectancy in the hopes of identifying where governments should allocate resources to address this problem. In this section, we explore differences in life expectancy in two ways: Differences between continents: Are there significant differences in average life expectancy between the six populated continents of the world: Africa, North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania? Differences within continents: How does life expectancy vary within the world’s five continents? For example, is the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Africa larger than the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Asia? To answer such questions, we use an updated version of the gapminder data frame we visualized in Figure 2.1 in Subsection 2.1.2 on the grammar of graphics. This updated data un_member_states_2024 data we worked with earlier in this chapter, and it is included in the moderndive package. This dataset has international development statistics such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for 193 countries for years near 2024. We use this data for basic regression again, but now using an explanatory variable \\(x\\) that is categorical, as opposed to the numerical explanatory variable model we used in the previous Section 5.1. A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) (a country’s life expectancy) and A single categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) (the continent that the country is a part of). When the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is categorical, the concept of a “best-fitting” regression line is a little different than the one we saw previously in Section 5.1 where the explanatory variable \\(x\\) was numerical. We study these differences shortly in Subsection 5.2.2, but first we conduct an exploratory data analysis. 5.2.1 Exploratory data analysis The data on the 193 countries can be found in the un_member_states_2024 data frame included in the moderndive package. However, to keep things simple, we select() only the subset of the variables we’ll consider in this chapter and focus only on rows where we have no missing values with na.omit(). We’ll save this data in a new data frame called gapminder2022: gapminder2022 &lt;- un_member_states_2024 |&gt; select(country, life_exp = life_expectancy_2022, continent, gdp_per_capita) |&gt; na.omit() We perform the first common step in an exploratory data analysis: looking at the raw data values. You can do this by using RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using the glimpse() command as introduced in Subsection 1.4.3 on exploring data frames: glimpse(gapminder2022) Rows: 188 Columns: 4 $ country &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Afghanistan&quot;, &quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;, &quot;Andorra&quot;, &quot;Angola… $ life_exp &lt;dbl&gt; 53.6, 79.5, 78.0, 83.4, 62.1, 77.8, 78.3, 76.1, 83.1, 8… $ continent &lt;fct&gt; Asia, Europe, Africa, Europe, Africa, North America, So… $ gdp_per_capita &lt;dbl&gt; 356, 6810, 4343, 41993, 3000, 19920, 13651, 7018, 65100… Observe that Rows: 188 indicates that there are 188 rows/observations in gapminder2022, where each row corresponds to one country. In other words, the observational unit is an individual country. Furthermore, observe that the variable continent is of type &lt;fct&gt;, which stands for factor, which is R’s way of encoding categorical variables. A full description of all the variables included in un_member_states_2024 can be found by reading the associated help file (run ?un_member_states_2024 in the console). However, we fully describe only the 39 variables we selected in gapminder2022: country: An identification variable of type character/text used to distinguish the 142 countries in the dataset. life_exp: A numerical variable of that country’s life expectancy at birth. This is the outcome variable \\(y\\) of interest. continent: A categorical variable with five levels. Here “levels” correspond to the possible categories: Africa, Asia, Americas, Europe, and Oceania. This is the explanatory variable \\(x\\) of interest. gdp_per_capita: A numerical variable of that country’s GDP per capita in US inflation-adjusted dollars that we’ll use as another outcome variable \\(y\\) in the Learning check at the end of this subsection. We look at a random sample of five out of the 188 countries in Table 5.4. gapminder2022 |&gt; sample_n(size = 5) TABLE 5.4: Random sample of 5 out of 193 countries country life_exp continent gdp_per_capita Panama 77.6 North America 17358 Micronesia, Federated States of 74.4 Oceania 3714 Burundi 67.4 Africa 259 United Arab Emirates 79.6 Asia 53708 India 67.2 Asia 2411 Note that random sampling will likely produce a different subset of 5 rows for you than what’s shown. Now that we have looked at the raw values in our gapminder2022 data frame and got a sense of the data, we move on to computing summary statistics. We once again apply the tidy_summary() function from the moderndive package. Recall from our previous EDA that this function takes in a data frame, summarizes it, and returns commonly used summary statistics. We take our gapminder2022 data frame, select() only the outcome and explanatory variables life_exp and continent, and pipe them into the tidy_summary() function: gapminder2022 |&gt; select(life_exp, continent) |&gt; tidy_summary() # A tibble: 7 × 11 column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 life_exp 188 &lt;NA&gt; nume… 53.6 69.4 73.8 75.2 78.4 89.6 6.93 2 continent 52 Africa fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 3 continent 44 Asia fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 4 continent 43 Europe fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 5 continent 23 North America fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 6 continent 14 Oceania fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 7 continent 12 South America fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA The tidy_summary() output now reports summaries for categorical variables and for the numerical variables we reviewed before. Let’s focus just on discussing the results for the categorical factor variable continent: n: The number of non-missing entries for each group group: Breaks down a categorical variable into its unique levels. For this variable, it corresponding to Africa, Asia, North and South America, Europe, and Oceania. type: The data type of the variable. Here, it is a factor. min to sd: These are missing since calculating the five-number summary, the mean, and standard deviation for categorical variables doesn’t make sense. Turning our attention to the summary statistics of the numerical variable life_exp, we observe that the global median life expectancy in 2022 was 75.14. Thus, half of the world’s countries (96 countries) had a life expectancy less than 75.14. The mean life expectancy of 73.55 is lower, however. Why is the mean life expectancy lower than the median? We can answer this question by performing the last of the three common steps in an exploratory data analysis: creating data visualizations. We visualize the distribution of our outcome variable \\(y\\) = life_exp in Figure 5.6. ggplot(gapminder2022, aes(x = life_exp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Number of countries&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of distribution of worldwide life expectancies&quot;) FIGURE 5.6: Histogram of life expectancy in 2022. We see that this data is left-skewed, also known as negatively skewed: there are a few countries with low life expectancy that are bringing down the mean life expectancy. However, the median is less sensitive to the effects of such outliers; hence, the median is greater than the mean in this case. Remember, however, that we want to compare life expectancies both between continents and within continents. In other words, our visualizations need to incorporate some notion of the variable continent. We can do this easily with a faceted histogram. Recall from Section 2.6 that facets allow us to split a visualization by the different values of another variable. We display the resulting visualization in Figure 5.7 by adding a facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) layer. ggplot(gapminder2022, aes(x = life_exp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Number of countries&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of distribution of worldwide life expectancies&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) FIGURE 5.7: Life expectancy in 2022. Observe that unfortunately the distribution of African life expectancies is much lower than the other continents. In Europe, life expectancies tend to be higher and furthermore do not vary as much. On the other hand, both Asia and Africa have the most variation in life expectancies. Recall that an alternative method to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable split by a categorical variable is by using a side-by-side boxplot. We map the categorical variable continent to the \\(x\\)-axis and the different life expectancies within each continent on the \\(y\\)-axis in Figure 5.8. ggplot(gapminder2022, aes(x = continent, y = life_exp)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Continent&quot;, y = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, title = &quot;Life expectancy by continent&quot;) FIGURE 5.8: Life expectancy in 2022. Some people prefer comparing the distributions of a numerical variable between different levels of a categorical variable using a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram. This is because we can make quick comparisons between the categorical variable’s levels with imaginary horizontal lines. For example, observe in Figure 5.8 that we can quickly convince ourselves that Europe has the highest median life expectancies by drawing an imaginary horizontal line near \\(y\\) = 81. Furthermore, as we observed in the faceted histogram in Figure 5.7, Africa and Asia have the largest variation in life expectancy as evidenced by their large interquartile ranges (the heights of the boxes). It’s important to remember, however, that the solid lines in the middle of the boxes correspond to the medians (the middle value) rather than the mean (the average). So, for example, if you look at Asia, the solid line denotes the median life expectancy of around 75 years. This tells us that half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy below 75 years, whereas half have a life expectancy above 75 years. We compute the median and mean life expectancy for each continent with a little more data wrangling and display the results in Table 5.5. life_exp_by_continent &lt;- gapminder2022 |&gt; group_by(continent) |&gt; summarize(median = median(life_exp), mean = mean(life_exp)) life_exp_by_continent TABLE 5.5: Life expectancy by continent continent median mean Africa 66.1 66.3 Asia 75.4 75.0 Europe 81.5 79.9 North America 76.1 76.3 Oceania 74.6 74.4 South America 75.4 75.2 Observe the order of the second column median life expectancy: Africa is lowest, Oceania, South America, Asia, and North America are next with similar medians, and then Europe has the highest. This ordering corresponds to the ordering of the solid black lines inside the boxes in our side-by-side boxplot in Figure 5.8. We now turn our attention to the values in the third column mean. Using Africa’s mean life expectancy of 66.31 as a baseline for comparison, we start making comparisons to the mean life expectancies of the other four continents and put these values in Table 5.6, which we’ll revisit later on in this section. For Asia, it is 74.95 - 66.31 = 8.64 years higher. For Europe, it is 79.91 - 66.31 = 13.6 years higher. For North America, it is 76.29 - 66.31 = 9.98 years higher. For Oceania, it is 74.42 - 66.31 = 8.11 years higher. For South America, it is 75.23 - 66.31 = 8.92 years higher. TABLE 5.6: Mean life expectancy by continent and relative differences from mean for Africa continent mean Difference versus Africa Africa 66.3 0.00 Asia 75.0 8.64 Europe 79.9 13.60 North America 76.3 9.99 Oceania 74.4 8.11 South America 75.2 8.92 Learning check (LC5.4) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same explanatory variable \\(x\\) being continent but with gdp_per_capita as the new outcome variable \\(y\\). What can you say about the differences in GDP per capita between continents based on this exploration? 5.2.2 Linear regression In Subsection 5.1.2 we introduced simple linear regression, which involves modeling the relationship between a numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) and a numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\). In our life expectancy example, we now instead have a categorical explanatory variable continent. Our model will not yield a “best-fitting” regression line like in Figure 5.3, but rather offsets relative to a baseline for comparison. As we did in Subsection 5.1.2 when studying the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy, we output the regression coefficients for this model. Recall that this is done in two steps: We first “fit” the linear regression model using the lm(y ~ x, data) function and save it in life_exp_model. We get the regression coefficients by applying the coef() function to life_exp_model. life_exp_model &lt;- lm(life_exp ~ continent, data = gapminder2022) coef(life_exp_model) (Intercept) continentAsia continentEurope 66.31 8.64 13.60 continentNorth America continentOceania continentSouth America 9.99 8.11 8.92 We once again focus on the values in these coefficient values. Why are there now 6 entries? We break them down one-by-one: intercept corresponds to the mean life expectancy of countries in Africa of 66.31 years. continentAsia corresponds to countries in Asia and the value +8.64 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 5.6. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in Asia is \\(66.31 + 8.64 = 74.95\\). continentEurope corresponds to countries in Europe and the value +13.6 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 5.6. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in Europe is \\(66.31 + 13.6 = 79.91\\). continentNorth America corresponds to countries in North America and the value +9.98 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 5.6. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in North America is \\(66.31 + 9.98 = 76.29\\). continentOceania corresponds to countries in Oceania and the value +8.11 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 5.6. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in Oceania is \\(66.31 + 8.11 = 74.42\\). continentSouth America corresponds to countries in South America and the value +8.92 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 5.6. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in South America is \\(66.31 + 8.92 = 75.23\\). To summarize, the 6 values for the regression coefficients correspond to the “baseline for comparison” continent Africa (the intercept) as well as five “offsets” from this baseline for the remaining 5 continents: Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. You might be asking at this point why was Africa chosen as the “baseline for comparison” group. This is the case for no other reason than it comes first alphabetically of the six continents; by default R arranges factors/categorical variables in alphanumeric order. You can change this baseline group to be another continent if you manipulate the variable continent’s factor “levels” using the forcats package. See Chapter 15 of R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2017) for examples. We now write the equation for our fitted values \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{life exp}}\\). \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania }}(x) + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Euro}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\end{aligned} \\] Whoa! That looks daunting! Don’t fret, however, as once you understand what all the elements mean, things simplify greatly. First, \\(\\mathbb{1}_{A}(x)\\) is what’s known in mathematics as an “indicator function.” It returns only one of two possible values, 0 and 1, where \\[ \\mathbb{1}_{A}(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x \\text{ is in } A \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. \\] In a statistical modeling context, this is also known as a dummy variable. In our case, we consider the first such indicator variable \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Amer}}(x)\\). This indicator function returns 1 if a country is in the Asia, 0 otherwise: \\[ \\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Amer}}(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if } \\text{country } x \\text{ is in Asia} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] Second, \\(b_0\\) corresponds to the intercept as before; in this case, it is the mean life expectancy of all countries in Africa. Third, the \\(b_{\\text{Asia}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{Europe}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{North America}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\), and \\(b_{\\text{South America}}\\) represent the 5 “offsets relative to the baseline for comparison” in the regression coefficients. We put this all together and compute the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{life exp}}\\) for a country in Africa. Since the country is in Africa, all five indicator functions \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x)\\), \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\), \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x)\\), \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x)\\), and \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\) will equal 0, and thus: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot 0 + 13.6\\cdot 0 + 9.98\\cdot 0 + 8.11\\cdot 0 + 8.92\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 \\end{aligned} \\] In other words, all that is left is the intercept \\(b_0\\), corresponding to the average life expectancy of African countries of 66.31 years. Next, say we are considering a country in Asia. In this case, only the indicator function \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x)\\) for Asia will equal 1, while all the others will equal 0, and thus: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot 1 + 13.6\\cdot 0 + 9.98\\cdot 0 + 8.11\\cdot 0 + 8.92\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64 \\\\ &amp; = 74.95 \\end{aligned} \\] which is the mean life expectancy for countries in Asia of 74.95 years in Table 5.6. Note the “offset from the baseline for comparison” is +8.64 years. We do one more. Say we are considering a country in South America. In this case, only the indicator function \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\) for South America will equal 1, while all the others will equal 0, and thus: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot 0 + 13.6\\cdot 0 + 9.98\\cdot 0 + 8.11\\cdot 0 + 8.92\\cdot 1\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.92 \\\\ &amp; = 75.23 \\end{aligned} \\] which is the mean life expectancy for South American countries of 75.23 years in Table 5.6. The “offset from the baseline for comparison” here is +8.64 years. We generalize this idea a bit. If we fit a linear regression model using a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) that has \\(k\\) possible categories, the regression table will return an intercept and \\(k - 1\\) “offsets.” In our case, since there are \\(k = 6\\) continents, the regression model returns an intercept corresponding to the baseline for comparison group of Africa and \\(k - 1 = 5\\) offsets corresponding to Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. Understanding a regression table output when you are using a categorical explanatory variable is a topic those new to regression often struggle with. The only real remedy for these struggles is practice, practice, practice. However, once you equip yourselves with an understanding of how to create regression models using categorical explanatory variables, you’ll be able to incorporate many new variables into your models, given the large amount of the world’s data that is categorical. Learning check (LC5.5) Fit a new linear regression using lm(gdp_per_capita ~ continent, data = gapminder2022) where gdp_per_capita is the new outcome variable \\(y\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression coefficients. How do the regression results match up with the results from your previous exploratory data analysis? 5.2.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals Recall in Subsection 5.1.3, we defined the following three concepts: Observed values \\(y\\), or the observed value of the outcome variable Fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\), or the value on the regression line for a given \\(x\\) value Residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\), or the error between the observed value and the fitted value We obtained these values and other values using the get_regression_points() function from the moderndive package. This time, however, we add an argument setting ID = \"country\": this is telling the function to use the variable country in gapminder2022 as an identification variable in the output. This will help contextualize our analysis by matching values to countries. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(life_exp_model, ID = &quot;country&quot;) regression_points TABLE 5.7: Regression points (First 10 out of 142 countries) country life_exp continent life_exp_hat residual Afghanistan 53.6 Asia 75.0 -21.300 Albania 79.5 Europe 79.9 -0.438 Algeria 78.0 Africa 66.3 11.720 Andorra 83.4 Europe 79.9 3.512 Angola 62.1 Africa 66.3 -4.200 Antigua and Barbuda 77.8 North America 76.3 1.505 Argentina 78.3 South America 75.2 3.083 Armenia 76.1 Asia 75.0 1.180 Australia 83.1 Oceania 74.4 8.674 Austria 82.3 Europe 79.9 2.362 Observe in Table 5.7 that life_exp_hat contains the fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) = \\(\\widehat{\\text{life exp}}\\). If you look closely, there are only 5 possible values for life_exp_hat. These correspond to the five mean life expectancies for the 5 continents that we displayed in Table 5.6 and computed using the regression coefficient values. The residual column is simply \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = life_exp - life_exp_hat. These values can be interpreted as the deviation of a country’s life expectancy from its continent’s average life expectancy. For example, look at the first row of Table 5.7 corresponding to Afghanistan. The residual of \\(y - \\widehat{y} = 53.6 - 74.95 = -21.4\\) is telling us that Afghanistan’s life expectancy is a whopping 21.4 years lower than the mean life expectancy of all Asian countries. This can in part be explained by the many years of war that country had suffered. Learning check (LC5.6) Using either the sorting functionality of RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or using the data wrangling tools you learned in Chapter 3, identify the five countries with the five smallest (most negative) residuals? What do these negative residuals say about their life expectancy relative to their continents’ life expectancy? (LC5.7) Repeat this process, but identify the five countries with the five largest (most positive) residuals. What do these positive residuals say about their life expectancy relative to their continents’ life expectancy? 5.3 Related topics 5.3.1 Correlation is not necessarily causation Throughout this chapter we have been cautious when interpreting regression slope coefficients. We always discussed the “associated” effect of an explanatory variable \\(x\\) on an outcome variable \\(y\\). For example, our statement from Subsection 5.1.2 that “for every increase of 1 unit in life_exp, there is an associated decrease of on average 0.137 units of fert_rate.” We include the term “associated” to be extra careful not to suggest we are making a causal statement. So while life_exp is negatively correlated with fert_rate, we can’t necessarily make any statements about life expectancy’s direct causal effect on fertility rates without more information. Here is another example: a not-so-great medical doctor goes through medical records and finds that patients who slept with their shoes on tended to wake up more with headaches. So this doctor declares, “Sleeping with shoes on causes headaches!” FIGURE 5.9: Does sleeping with shoes on cause headaches? However, there is a good chance that if someone is sleeping with their shoes on, it is potentially because they are intoxicated from alcohol. Furthermore, higher levels of drinking leads to more hangovers, and hence more headaches. The amount of alcohol consumption here is what’s known as a confounding/lurking variable. It “lurks” behind the scenes, confounding the causal relationship (if any) of “sleeping with shoes on” with “waking up with a headache.” We can summarize this in Figure 5.10 with a causal graph where: Y is a response variable; here it is “waking up with a headache.” X is a treatment variable whose causal effect we are interested in; here it is “sleeping with shoes on.” FIGURE 5.10: Causal graph. To study the relationship between Y and X, we could use a regression model where the outcome variable is set to Y and the explanatory variable is set to be X, as you’ve been doing throughout this chapter. However, Figure 5.10 also includes a third variable with arrows pointing at both X and Y: Z is a confounding variable that affects both X and Y, thereby “confounding” their relationship. Here the confounding variable is alcohol. Alcohol will cause people to be both more likely to sleep with their shoes on as well as be more likely to wake up with a headache. Thus any regression model of the relationship between X and Y should also use Z as an explanatory variable. In other words, our doctor needs to take into account who had been drinking the night before. In the next chapter, we’ll start covering multiple regression models that allow us to incorporate more than one variable in our regression models. Establishing causation is a tricky problem and frequently takes either carefully designed experiments or methods to control for the effects of confounding variables. Both these approaches attempt, as best they can, either to take all possible confounding variables into account or negate their impact. This allows researchers to focus only on the relationship of interest: the relationship between the outcome variable Y and the treatment variable X. As you read news stories, be careful not to fall into the trap of thinking that correlation necessarily implies causation. Check out the Spurious Correlations website for some rather comical examples of variables that are correlated, but are definitely not causally related. Coming back to our UN member states data, a confounding variable could be the level of economic development of a country. This could affect both life expectancy and fertility rates. A proxy for looking at the level of economic development could be the Human Development Index (HDI). It measures a country’s average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: health (life expectancy), education (mean and expected years of schooling), and standard of living (gross national income per capita). This is stored in the hdi_2022 column of un_member_states_2024. We explore its relationship with life expectancy and fertility rates: ggplot(data = un_member_states_2024, aes(x = hdi_2022, y = life_expectancy_2022)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Human Development Index (HDI)&quot;, y = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) ggplot(data = un_member_states_2024, aes(x = hdi_2022, y = fertility_rate_2022)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Human Development Index (HDI)&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;) un_member_states_2024 |&gt; get_correlation(life_expectancy_2022 ~ hdi_2022, na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.889 un_member_states_2024 |&gt; get_correlation(fertility_rate_2022 ~ hdi_2022, na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.849 Looking at both of the scatterplots above, we see a strong positive linear relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and life expectancy, as well as a strong negative correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and fertility rates. The correlation coefficients between the Human Development Index (HDI) and life expectancy, as well as the Human Development Index (HDI) and fertility rates, are also given. These findings as well as some additional understanding of socioeconomic factors suggest that the Human Development Index (HDI) is a confounding variable in the relationship between life expectancy and fertility rates. 5.3.2 Best-fitting line Regression lines are also known as “best-fitting” lines. But what do we mean by “best”? We unpack the criteria that is used in regression to determine “best.” Recall Figure 5.4, where for Bosnia and Herzegovina we marked the observed value \\(y\\) with a circle, the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) with a square, and the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) with an arrow. We re-display Figure 5.4 in the top-left plot of Figure 5.11 in addition to three more arbitrarily chosen countries: FIGURE 5.11: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual. The four plots refer to: The country of Bosnia and Herzegovina had a life expectancy \\(x = 77.98\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 1.3\\). The residual in this case is \\(1.3 - 1.894 = -0.594\\), which we mark with a blue arrow in the top-left plot. The addition of Chad, which had a life expectancy \\(x = 59.15\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 6\\). The residual in this case is \\(6 - 4.479 = 1.521\\), which we mark with a new blue arrow in the top-right plot. The addition of India, which had a life expectancy \\(x = 67.22\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 2\\). The residual in this case is \\(2 - 3.371 = -1.371\\), which we mark with a new blue arrow in the bottom-left plot. The addition of the Solomon Islands, which had a life expectancy \\(x = 76.7\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 3.8\\). The residual in this case is \\(3.8 - 2.069 = 1.731\\), which we mark with a new blue arrow in the bottom-right plot. Now say we repeated this process of computing residuals for all 181 countries with complete information, then we squared all the residuals, and then we summed them. We call this quantity the sum of squared residuals; it is a measure of the lack of fit of a model. Larger values of the sum of squared residuals indicate a bigger lack of fit. This corresponds to a worse fitting model. If the regression line fits all the points perfectly, then the sum of squared residuals is 0. This is because if the regression line fits all the points perfectly, then the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) equals the observed value \\(y\\) in all cases, and hence the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = 0 in all cases, and the sum of even a large number of 0’s is still 0. Furthermore, of all possible lines we can draw through the cloud of 181 points, the regression line minimizes this value. In other words, the regression and its corresponding fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) minimizes the sum of the squared residuals: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i)^2 \\] We use our data wrangling tools from Chapter 3 to compute the sum of squared residuals exactly: # Fit regression model: demographics_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp, data = UN_data_ch5) # Get regression points: regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(demographics_model) regression_points # Compute sum of squared residuals regression_points |&gt; mutate(squared_residuals = residual^2) |&gt; summarize(sum_of_squared_residuals = sum(squared_residuals)) # A tibble: 181 × 5 ID fert_rate life_exp fert_rate_hat residual &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 4.3 53.6 5.23 -0.934 2 2 1.4 79.5 1.69 -0.289 3 3 2.7 78.0 1.89 0.813 4 4 5 62.1 4.07 0.928 5 5 1.6 77.8 1.92 -0.318 6 6 1.9 78.3 1.85 0.052 7 7 1.6 76.1 2.15 -0.548 8 8 1.6 83.1 1.19 0.408 9 9 1.5 82.3 1.30 0.195 10 10 1.6 74.2 2.42 -0.819 # ℹ 171 more rows Any other straight line drawn in the figure would yield a sum of squared residuals greater than 81.265. This is a mathematically guaranteed fact that you can prove using calculus and linear algebra. That’s why alternative names for the linear regression line are the best-fitting line and the least-squares line. Why do we square the residuals (i.e., the arrow lengths)? So that both positive and negative deviations of the same amount are treated equally. (That being said, while taking the absolute value of the residuals would also treat both positive and negative deviations of the same amount equally, squaring the residuals is used for reasons related to calculus: taking derivatives and minimizing functions. To learn more we suggest you consult a textbook on mathematical statistics.)

Compute the sum of squared residuals by hand for each line and show that of these three lines, the regression line in blue has the smallest value. 5.3.3 get_regression_x() functions Recall in this chapter we introduced a wrapper function from the moderndive package: get_regression_points() that returns point-by-point information from a regression model in Subsection 5.1.3. What is going on behind the scenes with the get_regression_points() function? We mentioned in Subsection 5.1.2 that this was an example of a wrapper function. Such functions take other pre-existing functions and “wrap” them into single functions that hide the user from their inner workings. This way all the user needs to worry about is what the inputs look like and what the outputs look like. In this subsection, we’ll “get under the hood” of these functions and see how the “engine” of these wrapper functions works. The get_regression_points() function is a wrapper function, returning information about the individual points involved in a regression model like the fitted values, observed values, and the residuals. get_regression_points() uses the augment() function in the broom package to produce the data shown in Table 5.8. Additionally, it uses the clean_names() from the janitor package (Firke 2023) to clean up the variable names. library(broom) library(janitor) demographics_model |&gt; augment() |&gt; mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 3) |&gt; clean_names() |&gt; select(-c(&quot;std_resid&quot;, &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;, &quot;cooksd&quot;, &quot;std_resid&quot;)) TABLE 5.8: Regression points using augment() from broom package fert_rate life_exp fitted resid 4.3 53.6 5.23 -0.934 1.4 79.5 1.69 -0.289 2.7 78.0 1.89 0.813 5.0 62.1 4.07 0.928 1.6 77.8 1.92 -0.318 1.9 78.3 1.85 0.052 1.6 76.1 2.15 -0.548 1.6 83.1 1.19 0.408 1.5 82.3 1.30 0.195 1.6 74.2 2.42 -0.819 In this case, it outputs only the variables of interest to students learning regression: the outcome variable \\(y\\) (fert_rate), all explanatory/predictor variables (life_exp), all resulting fitted values \\(\\hat{y}\\) used by applying the equation of the regression line to life_exp, and the residual \\(y - \\hat{y}\\). If you are even more curious about how these and other wrapper functions work, take a look at the source code for these functions on GitHub. 5.4 Conclusion 5.4.1 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. As we suggested in Subsection 5.1.1, interpreting coefficients that are not close to the extreme values of -1, 0, and 1 can be somewhat subjective. To help develop your sense of correlation coefficients, we suggest you play the 80s-style video game called, “Guess the Correlation”, at http://guessthecorrelation.com/. FIGURE 5.13: Preview of “Guess the Correlation” game. 5.4.2 What’s to come? In this chapter, you’ve studied the term simple linear regression, where you fit models that only have one explanatory variable. In Chapter 6, we’ll study multiple regression, where our regression models can now have more than one explanatory variable moving a little bit more advanced than the basic form of simple linear regression! In particular, we’ll consider two scenarios: regression models with one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable and regression models with two numerical explanatory variables. This will allow you to construct more sophisticated and more powerful models, all in the hopes of better explaining your outcome variable \\(y\\). References "],["6-multiple-regression.html", "Chapter 6 Multiple Regression Needed packages 6.1 One numerical and one categorical explanatory variable 6.2 Two numerical explanatory variables 6.3 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Multiple Regression In Chapter 5 we studied simple linear regression as a model that represents the relationship between two variables: an outcome variable or response \\(y\\) and an explanatory variable or regressor \\(x\\). Furthermore to keep things simple, we only considered models with one explanatory \\(x\\) variable that was either numerical in Section 5.1 or categorical in Section 5.2. In this chapter we introduce multiple linear regression, the direct extension to simple linear regression when more than one explanatory variable is taking into account to explain changes in the outcome variable. As we show in the next few sections, much of the material developed for simple linear regression translates directly into multiple linear regression, but the interpretation of the associated effect of any one explanatory variable must be made taking into account the other explanatory variables included in the model. Needed packages If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(ISLR2) 6.1 One numerical and one categorical explanatory variable We continue using the UN member states data set introduced in Section 5.1. Recall that we studied the relationship between the outcome variable fertility rate, \\(y\\), and the regressor life expectancy, \\(x\\). In this section, we introduce one additional regressor to this model: the categorical variable income group with four categories: Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. We now want to study how fertility rate changes due to changes in life expectancy and different income levels. To do this, we use multiple regression. Observe that we now have: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\), the fertility rate in a given country or state, and Two explanatory variables: A numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\), the life expectancy. A categorical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\), the income group. 6.1.1 Exploratory data analysis The UN member states data frame is included in the moderndive package. To keep things simple, we select() only the subset of the variables needed here, and save this data in a new data frame called UN_data_ch6. Note that the variables used are different than the ones chosen in Chapter 5. We also set the income variable to be a factor so that its levels show up in the expected order. UN_data_ch6 &lt;- un_member_states_2024 |&gt; select(country, life_expectancy_2022, fertility_rate_2022, income_group_2024)|&gt; na.omit()|&gt; rename(life_exp = life_expectancy_2022, fert_rate = fertility_rate_2022, income = income_group_2024)|&gt; mutate(income = factor(income, levels = c(&quot;Low income&quot;, &quot;Lower middle income&quot;, &quot;Upper middle income&quot;, &quot;High income&quot;))) Recall the three common steps in an exploratory data analysis we saw in Subsection 5.1.1: Inspecting a sample of raw values. Computing summary statistics. Creating data visualizations. We first look at the raw data values by either looking at UN_data_ch6 using RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using the glimpse() function from the dplyr package: glimpse(UN_data_ch6) Rows: 182 Columns: 4 $ country &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Afghanistan&quot;, &quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;, &quot;Angola&quot;, &quot;Antigua and … $ life_exp &lt;dbl&gt; 53.6, 79.5, 78.0, 62.1, 77.8, 78.3, 76.1, 83.1, 82.3, 74.2, … $ fert_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 4.3, 1.4, 2.7, 5.0, 1.6, 1.9, 1.6, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.8, … $ income &lt;fct&gt; Low income, Upper middle income, Lower middle income, Lower … The variable country contains all the UN member states. R reads this variable as character, &lt;chr&gt;, and beyond the country identification it will not be needed for the analysis. The variables life expectancy, life_exp, and fertility rate, fert_rate, are numerical, and the variable income, income, is categorical. In R, categorical variables are called factors and the categories are factor levels. We also display a random sample of 5 rows of the 182 rows corresponding to different countries in Table 6.1. Remember due to the random nature of the sampling, you will likely end up with a different subset of 5 rows. UN_data_ch6 |&gt; sample_n(size = 5) TABLE 6.1: A random sample of 5 out of 182 UN member states country life_exp fert_rate income Trinidad and Tobago 75.9 1.6 High income Micronesia, Federated States of 74.4 2.6 Lower middle income North Macedonia 76.8 1.4 Upper middle income Portugal 81.5 1.4 High income Madagascar 68.2 3.7 Low income Life expectancy, life_exp, is an estimate of how many years, on average, a person in a given country is expected to live. Fertility rate, fert_rate, is the average number of live births per woman of childbearing age in a country. As we did in our exploratory data analyses in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 from the previous chapter, we obtain summary statistics: UN_data_ch6 |&gt; select(life_exp, fert_rate, income) |&gt; tidy_summary() # A tibble: 6 × 11 column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 life_exp 182 &lt;NA&gt; nume… 53.6 69.4 73.7 75.2 78.4 86.4 6.86 2 fert_rate 182 &lt;NA&gt; nume… 0.9 1.6 2.49 2 3.2 6.6 1.16 3 income 25 Low income fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 4 income 52 Lower middle… fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 5 income 49 Upper middle… fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 6 income 56 High income fact… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA Recall that each row in UN_data_ch6 represents a particular country or UN member state. The tidy_summary() function shows a summary for the numerical variables life expectancy (life_exp), fertility rate (fert_rate), and the categorical variable income group (income). When the variable is numerical, the tidy_summary() function provides the total number of observations in the data frame, the five-number summary, the mean, and the standard deviation. For example, the first row of our summary refers to life expectancy as life_exp. There are 182 observations for this variable, it is a numerical variable, and the first quartile, Q1, is 69.4; this means that the life expectancy of 25% of the UN member states is less than 69.4 years. When a variable in the data set is categorical, also called a factor, the summary shows all the categories or factor levels and the number of observations for each level. For example, income group, income, is a factor with four factor levels: Low Income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. The summary also provides the number of states for each factor level; observe, for example, that the data set has 56 UN members states that are considered High Income states. Furthermore, we can compute the correlation coefficient between our two numerical variables: life_exp and fert_rate. Recall from Subsection 5.1.1 that correlation coefficients only exist between numerical variables. We observe that they are “strongly negatively” correlated. UN_data_ch6 |&gt; get_correlation(formula = fert_rate ~ life_exp) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.815 We are ready to create data visualizations, the last of our exploratory data analysis. Given that the outcome variable fert_rate and explanatory variable life_exp are both numerical, we can create a scatterplot to display their relationship, as we did in Figure 5.2. But this time, we incorporate the categorical variable income by mapping this variable to the color aesthetic, thereby creating a colored scatterplot. ggplot(UN_data_ch6, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate, color = income)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;, color = &quot;Income group&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 6.1: Colored scatterplot of relationship of teaching score and age. In the resulting Figure 6.1, observe that ggplot() assigns a default color scheme to the points and to the lines associated with the four levels of income: Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. Furthermore, the geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) layer automatically fits a different regression line for each group. We can see some interesting trends. First, observe that we get a different line for each income group. Second, the slopes for all the income groups are negative. Third, the slope for the High income group is clearly less steep than the slopes for all other three groups. So, the changes in fertility rate due to changes in life expectancy are dependent on the level of income of a given country. Fourth, observe that high income countries have, in general, high life expectancy and low fertility rates. 6.1.2 Model with interactions We can represent the four regression lines in Figure 6.1 as a multiple regression model with interactions. Before we do this, however, we review a linear regression with only one categorical explanatory variable. Recall in Subsection 5.2.2 we fit a regression model for each country life expectancy as a function of the corresponding continent. We produce the corresponding analysis here, now using the fertility rate as the response variable and the income group as the categorical explanatory variable. We’ll use slightly different notation to what was done previously to make the model more general. A linear model with a categorical explanatory variable is called a one-factor model where factor refers to the categorical explanatory variable and the categories are also called factor levels. We represent the categories using indicator functions or dummy variables. In our UN data example, The variable income has four categories or levels: Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. The corresponding dummy variables needed are: \\[ D_1 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has low income} \\phantom{asfdasfd} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[ D_2 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has lower middle income} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[ D_3 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has high middle income}\\phantom{a} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[ D_4 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has high income} \\phantom{asfdafd}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right.\\\\ \\] So, for example, if a given UN member state has Low income, its dummy variables are \\(D_1 = 1\\) and \\(D_2 = D_3 = D_4 = 0\\). Similarly, if another UN member state has High middle income, then its dummy variables would be \\(D_1 = D_2 = D_4 = 0\\) and \\(D_3 = 1\\). Using dummy variables, the mathematical formulation of the linear regression for our example is: \\[\\hat y = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_2 D_2 + b_3 D_3 + b_4 D_4\\] or if we want to express it in terms of the \\(i\\)th observation in our data set, we can include the \\(i\\)th subscript: \\[\\hat y_i = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_2 D_{2i} + b_3 D_{3i} + b_4 D_{4i}\\] Recall that the coefficient \\(b_0\\) represents the intercept and the coefficients \\(b_2\\), \\(b_3\\), and \\(b_4\\) are the offsets based on the appropriate category. The dummy variables, \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\), and \\(D_4\\), take the values of zero or one depending on the corresponding category of any given country. Observe also that \\(D_1\\) does not appear in the model. The reason for this is entirely mathematical: if the model would contain an intercept and all the dummy variables, the model would be over-specified, that is, it would contain one redundant explanatory variable. The solution is to drop one of the variables. We keep the intercept because it provides flexibility when interpreting more complicated models, and we drop one of the dummy variables which, by default in R, is the first dummy variable, \\(D_1\\). This does not mean that we are losing information of the first level \\(D_1\\). If a country is part of the Low income level, \\(D_1 = 1\\), \\(D_2 = D_3 = D_4 = 0\\), so most of the terms in the regression are zero and the linear regression becomes: \\[\\hat y = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0\\] So the intercept represents the average fertility rate when the country is a Low income country. Similarly, if another country is part of the High middle income level, then \\(D_1 = D_2 = D_4 = 0\\) and \\(D_3 = 1\\) so the linear regression becomes: \\[\\hat y = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_3\\] The average fertility rate for a High middle income country is \\(b_0 + b_3\\). Observe that \\(b_3\\) is an offset for life expectancy between the baseline level and the High middle income level. The same logic applies to the model for each possible income category. We obtain the regression coefficients using the lm() function and the command coef() to obtain the coefficients of the linear regression: one_factor_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ income, data = UN_data_ch6) coef(one_factor_model) We present these results on a table with the mathematical notation used above: Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 4.28 incomeLower middle income b2 -1.30 incomeUpper middle income b3 -2.25 incomeHigh income b4 -2.65 The first level, Low income, is the “baseline” group. The average fertility rate for Low income UN member states is 4.28. Similarly, the average fertility rate for Upper middle income member states is 4.28 + -2.25 = 2.03. We are now ready to study the multiple linear regression model with interactions shown in Figure 6.1. In this figure we can identify three different effects. First, for any fixed level of life expectancy, observe that there are four different fertility rates. They represent the effect of the categorical explanatory variable, income. Second, for any given regression line, the slope represents the change in average fertility rate due to changes on life expectancy. This is the effect of the numerical explanatory variable life_exp. Third, observe that the slope of the line depends on the income level; as an illustration, observe that for High income member states the slope is less steep than for Low income member states. When the slope changes due to changes in the explanatory variable, we call this an interaction effect. The mathematical formulation of the linear regression model with two explanatory variables, one numerical and one categorical, and interactions is: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 &amp;+ b_{02}D_2 + b_{03}D_3 + b_{04}D_4 \\\\ &amp;+ b_1x \\\\ &amp;+ b_{12}xD_2 + b_{13}xD_3 + b_{14}xD_4\\end{aligned}\\] The linear regression shows how the average life expectancy is affected by the categorical variable, the numerical variable, and the interaction effects. There are eight coefficients in our model and we have separated their coefficients into three lines to highlight their different roles. The first line shows the intercept and the effects of the categorical explanatory variables. Recall that \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\) and \\(D_4\\) are the dummy variables in the model and each is equal to one or zero depending the category of the country at hand; correspondingly, the coefficients \\(b_{02}\\), \\(b_{03}\\), and \\(b_{04}\\) are the offsets with respect to the baseline level of the intercept, \\(b_0\\). Recall that the first dummy variable has been dropped and the intercept captures this effect. The second line in the equation represent the effect of the numerical variable, \\(x\\). In our example \\(x\\) is the value of life expectancy. The coefficient \\(b_1\\) is the slope of the line and represents the change in fertility rate due to one unit change in life expectancy. The third line in the equation represents the interaction effects on the slopes. Observe that they are a combination of life expectancy, \\(x\\), and income level, \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\), and \\(D_4\\). What these interaction effects do is to modify the slope for different levels of income. For example, for a Low income member state, the dummy variables are \\(D_1 = 1\\), \\(D_2 = D_3 = D_4 = 0\\) and our linear regression is: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{02}\\cdot 0 + b_{03}\\cdot 0 + b_{04}\\cdot 0 + b_1x + b_{12}x\\cdot 0 + b_{13}x\\cdot 0 + b_{14}x\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp; = b_0 + b_1x \\end{aligned}\\] Similarly, for a High income member state, the dummy variables are \\(D_1 = D_2 =D_3 = 0\\), and \\(D_4 = 1\\). We take into account the offsets for the intercept, \\(b_{04}\\), and the slope, \\(b_{14}\\), and the linear regression becomes: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{02}\\cdot 0 + b_{03}\\cdot 0 + b_{04}\\cdot 1 + b_1 x + b_{12}x\\cdot 0 + b_{13}x\\cdot 0 + b_{14}x\\cdot 1\\\\ &amp; = b_0 + b_{04} + b_1x + b_{14}x\\\\ &amp; = (b_0 + b_{04}) + (b_1 + b_{14})\\cdot x\\end{aligned}\\] Observe how the intercept and the slope are different for a High income member state when compared to the baseline Low income member state. As an illustration, we construct this multiple linear regression for the UN member state data set in R. We first “fit” the model using the lm() “linear model” function and then obtain the coefficients using the function coef(). In R, the formula used is y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2 where x1 and x2 are the variable names in the data set and represent the main effects while x1:x2 is the interaction term. For simplicity, we can also write y ~ x1 * x2 as the * sign accounts for both, main effects and interaction effects. R would let both x1 and x2 be either explanatory or numerical, and we need to make sure the data set format is appropriate for the regression we want to run. Here is the code for our example: # Fit regression model: model_int &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp * income, data = UN_data_ch6) # Get the coefficients of the model coef(model_int) TABLE 6.2: Regression table for interaction model Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 11.918 incomeLower middle income b02 -1.504 incomeUpper middle income b03 -1.893 incomeHigh income b04 -6.580 life_exp b1 -0.118 incomeLower middle income:life_exp b12 0.013 incomeUpper middle income:life_exp b13 0.011 incomeHigh income:life_exp b14 0.072 We can match the coefficients with the values obtained: the fitted fertility rate \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}}\\) for Low income countries is \\[\\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_1\\cdot x = 11.92 + -0.12\\cdot x,\\] which is the equation of the regression line in Figure 6.1 for low income countries. The regression has an intercept of 11.92 and a slope of -0.12. Since life expectancy is greater than zero for all countries, the intercept has no practical interpretation and we only need it to produce the most appropriate line. The interpretation of the slope is the following: for Low income countries, every additional year of life expectancy reduces the average fertility rate by 0.12 units. As discussed earlier, the intercept and slope for all the other income groups are obtained by taking into account the appropriate offsets. As an illustration, for High income countries \\(D_4 = 1\\) and all other dummy variables are equal to zero. The regression line becomes \\[\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_1x + b_{04} + b_{14}x = (b_0 + b_{04} ) + (b_1+b_{14})x \\] where \\(x\\) is life expectancy, life_exp. The intercept is \\(b_0 + b_{04}\\) = \\(`(Intercept) + incomeHigh income` = 11.92 +(-6.58) = 5.34\\), and the slope for these High income countries is life_exp + life_exp:incomeHigh income \\(b_1 + b_{14}= -0.12 + 0.07 = -0.05\\). For High income countries, every additional year of life expectancy reduces the average fertility rate by 0.05 units. The intercepts and slopes for other income levels are obtained similarly. Since the life expectancy for Low income countries has a steeper slope than High income countries, one additional year of life expectancy will decrease fertility rates more for the low income group than for the high income group. This is consistent with our observation from Figure 6.1. When the associated effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable we say that there is an interaction effect. This is the reason why the regression slopes are different for different income groups. 6.1.3 A model without interactions We can simplify the previous model by removing the interaction effects. The model still represents different income groups with different regression lines by allowing different intercepts but all the lines have the same slope: they are parallel as shown in Figure 6.2. To plot parallel slopes we use the function geom_parallel_slopes() that is included in the moderndive package. To use this function you need to load both the ggplot2 and moderndive packages. Observe how the code is identical to the one used for the model with interactions in Figure 6.1, but now the geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) layer is replaced with geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE). ggplot(UN_data_ch6, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate, color = income)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility rate&quot;, color = &quot;Income group&quot;) + geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE) FIGURE 6.2: Parallel slopes model of score with age and gender. The regression lines for each income group are shown in Figure 6.2. Observe that the lines are now parallel: they all have the same negative slope. The interpretation of this result is that the change in fertility rate due to changes in life expectancy in a given country are the same regardless the income group of this country. On the other hand, any two regression lines in Figure 6.2 have different intercepts representing the income group; in particular, observe that for any fixed level of life expectancy the fertility rate is greater for Low income and Lower middle income countries than for Upper middle income and High income countries. The mathematical formulation of the linear regression model with two explanatory variables, one numerical and one categorical, and without interactions is: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_{02}D_2 + b_{03}D_3 + b_{04}D_4+ b_1x.\\] Observe that the dummy variables only affect the intercept now, and the slope is fully described by \\(b_1\\) for any income group. In the UN data example, a High income country, with \\(D_4 = 1\\) and the other dummy variables equal to zero, will be represented by \\[\\widehat{y} = (b_0 + b_{04})+ b_1x.\\] To obtain the coefficients for this regression in R, the formula used is y ~ x1 + x2 where x1 and x2 are the variable names in the data set and represent the main effects. Observe that the term x1:x2 representing the interaction is no longer included. R would let both x1 and x2 to be either explanatory or numerical; therefore, we should always check that the variable format is appropriate for the regression we want to run. Here is the code for the UN data example: # Fit regression model: model_no_int &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp + income, data = UN_data_ch6) # Get the coefficients of the model coef(model_no_int) TABLE 6.3: Regression table for a model without interactions Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 10.768 incomeLower middle income b02 -0.719 incomeUpper middle income b03 -1.239 incomeHigh income b04 -1.067 life_exp b1 -0.101 In this model without interactions, the slope is the same for all the regression lines, \\(b_1 = -0.101\\). Assuming that this model is correct, for any UN member state, every additional year of life expectancy reduces the average fertility rate by 0.101 units, regardless of the income level of the member state. The intercept of the regression line for Low income member states is 10.768 while for High income member states is 10.768+-1.067 = 9.701. The intercepts for other income levels can be obtained similarly. We compare the visualizations for both models side-by-side in Figure 6.3. FIGURE 6.3: Comparison of interaction and parallel slopes models. Which one is the preferred model? Looking at the scatterplot and the clusters of points in Figure 6.3, it does appear that lines with different slopes capture better the behavior of different groups of points. The lines do not appear to be parallel and the interaction model seems more appropriate. 6.1.4 Observed responses, fitted values and residuals In this subsection, we work with the regression model with interactions. The coefficients for this model were obtained earlier, saved in model_int, and shown below: TABLE 6.4: Regression table for interaction model Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 11.918 incomeLower middle income b02 -1.504 incomeUpper middle income b03 -1.893 incomeHigh income b04 -6.580 life_exp b1 -0.118 incomeLower middle income:life_exp b12 0.013 incomeUpper middle income:life_exp b13 0.011 incomeHigh income:life_exp b14 0.072 We can use these coefficient to obtain the fitted values and residuals for any given observation. As an illustration, we chose two observations from the UN member states data set, provided the values for the explanatory variables and response, as well as the fitted values and residuals: ID fert_rate income life_exp fert_rate_hat residual 1 1.3 High income 79.7 1.65 -0.35 2 5.7 Low income 62.4 4.52 1.18 The first observation is a High income country with a life expectancy of 79.74 years and an observed fertility rate equal to 1.3. The second observation is a Low income country with a life expectancy of 62.41 years and an observed fertility rate equal to 5.7 The fitted value, \\(\\hat y\\), called fert_rate_hat in the table, is the estimated value of the response determined by the regression line. This value is obtained by using the values of the explanatory variables and the coefficients of the linear regression. In addition, recall the difference between the observed response value and the fitted value, \\(y - \\hat y\\), is called the residual. We illustrate this in Figure 6.4. The vertical line on the left represents the life expectancy value for the Low income country. The y-value for the large dot on the regression line that intersects the vertical line is the fitted value for fertility rate, \\(\\widehat y\\), and the y-value for the large dot above the line is the observed fertility rate, \\(y\\). The difference between these values, \\(y - \\widehat y\\), is called the residual and in this case is positive. Similarly, the vertical line on the right represents the life expectancy value for the High income country, the y-value for the large dot on the regression line is the fitted fertility rate. The observed y-value for fertility rate is below the regression line making the residual negative. FIGURE 6.4: Fitted values for two new professors. We can generalize the study of fitted values and residuals for all the countries in the UN_data_ch6 data set, as shown in Table 6.5. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(model_int) regression_points TABLE 6.5: Regression points (First 10 out of 182 countries) ID fert_rate income life_exp fert_rate_hat residual 1 4.3 Low income 53.6 5.56 -1.262 2 1.4 Upper middle income 79.5 1.50 -0.098 3 2.7 Lower middle income 78.0 2.16 0.544 4 5.0 Lower middle income 62.1 3.84 1.159 5 1.6 High income 77.8 1.74 -0.139 6 1.9 Upper middle income 78.3 1.62 0.278 7 1.6 Upper middle income 76.1 1.86 -0.256 8 1.6 High income 83.1 1.50 0.105 9 1.5 High income 82.3 1.53 -0.033 10 1.6 Upper middle income 74.2 2.07 -0.469 Learning check (LC6.1) Compute the observed response values, fitted values, and residuals for the model without interactions. 6.2 Two numerical explanatory variables We now consider regression models with two numerical explanatory variables. To illustrate this situation we use the Credit data set from the ISLR2 R package. This data set contains simulated information for 400 customers. For the regression model we use the credit card balance (Balance) as the response variable; and the credit limit (Limit), and the income (Income) as the numerical explanatory variables. 6.2.1 Exploratory data analysis We load the Credit data frame and construct a new data frame credit_ch6 with only the variables needed. We do this by using the select() verb as we did in Subsection 3.8.1 and, in addition, we save the selecting variables with different names: Balance becomes debt, Limit becomes credit_limit, and Income becomes income. Here is the code: library(ISLR2) credit_ch6 &lt;- Credit |&gt; as_tibble() |&gt; select(debt = Balance, credit_limit = Limit, income = Income, credit_rating = Rating, age = Age) You can observe the effect of our use of select() but looking at the raw values either in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using glimpse(). glimpse(credit_ch6) Rows: 400 Columns: 5 $ debt &lt;dbl&gt; 333, 903, 580, 964, 331, 1151, 203, 872, 279, 1350, 1407… $ credit_limit &lt;dbl&gt; 3606, 6645, 7075, 9504, 4897, 8047, 3388, 7114, 3300, 68… $ income &lt;dbl&gt; 14.9, 106.0, 104.6, 148.9, 55.9, 80.2, 21.0, 71.4, 15.1,… $ credit_rating &lt;dbl&gt; 283, 483, 514, 681, 357, 569, 259, 512, 266, 491, 589, 1… $ age &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 82, 71, 36, 68, 77, 37, 87, 66, 41, 30, 64, 57, 49, … Furthermore, we present a random sample of five out of the 400 credit card holders in Table 6.6. As observed before, each time you run this code a different subset of five rows is obtained. credit_ch6 |&gt; sample_n(size = 5) TABLE 6.6: Random sample of 5 credit card holders debt credit_limit income credit_rating age 1809 13414 186.6 949 41 126 4411 58.4 326 85 580 4632 21.8 355 50 1404 5533 26.4 433 50 50 3327 35.0 253 54 Note that income is in thousands of dollars while debt and credit limit are in dollars. We can also compute summary statistics using the tidy_summary() function. We only select() the columns of interest for our model: credit_ch6 |&gt; select(debt, credit_limit, income) |&gt; tidy_summary() # A tibble: 3 × 11 column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 debt 400 &lt;NA&gt; nume… 0 68.8 520. 460. 863 1999 460. 2 credit_limit 400 &lt;NA&gt; nume… 855 3088 4736. 4622. 5873. 13913 2308. 3 income 400 &lt;NA&gt; nume… 10.4 21.0 45.2 33.1 57.5 187. 35.2 The mean and median credit card debt are $520.0 and $459.5, respectively. The first quartile for debt is 68.8; this means that 25% of card holders had debts of $68.80 or less. Correspondingly, the mean and median credit card limit, credit_limit, are around $4,736 and $4,622, respectively. Note also that the third quartile of income is 57.5; so 75% of card holders had incomes below $57,500. We visualize the relationship of the response variable with each of the two explanatory variables using the R code below. There plots are shown in Figure 6.5. ggplot(credit_ch6, aes(x = credit_limit, y = debt)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Credit limit (in $)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card debt (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Debt and credit limit&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) ggplot(credit_ch6, aes(x = income, y = debt)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Income (in $1000)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card debt (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Debt and income&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 6.5: Relationship between credit card debt and credit limit/income. The left plot in Figure 6.5 shows a positive and linear association between credit limit and credit card debt: as credit limit increases so does credit card debt. Observe also that many customers have no credit card debt and there is a cluster of points at the credit card debt value of zero. The right plot in Figure 6.5 shows also positive and somewhat linear association between income an credit card debt, but this association seems weaker and actually appears positive only for incomes larger than $50,000. For lower income values it is not clear there is any association at all. Since variables debt, credit_limit, and income are numerical, and more importantly, the associations between the response and explanatory variables appear to be linear or close to linear, we can also obtain the correlation coefficient between any two of these variables. Recall that the correlation coefficient is appropriate if the association between the variables is linear. One way to do this is using the get_correlation() command as seen in Subsection 5.1.1, once for each explanatory variable with the response debt: credit_ch6 |&gt; get_correlation(debt ~ credit_limit) credit_ch6 |&gt; get_correlation(debt ~ income) Alternatively, using the select() verb and command cor() we can obtain all correlations simultaneously by returning a correlation matrix as shown in Table 6.7. This matrix shows the correlation coefficient for any pair of variables in the appropriate row/column combination. credit_ch6 |&gt; select(debt, credit_limit, income) |&gt; cor() TABLE 6.7: Correlation coefficients between credit card debt, credit limit, and income debt credit_limit income debt 1.000 0.862 0.464 credit_limit 0.862 1.000 0.792 income 0.464 0.792 1.000 We describe some findings presented in the correlation matrix: The diagonal values are all 1 because, based on the definition of the correlation coefficient, the correlation of a variable with itself is always 1. The correlation between debt and credit_limit is 0.862. This indicates a strong and positive linear relationship: the greater the credit limit is, the larger is the credit card debt, on average. The correlation between debt and income is 0.464. The linear relationship is positive albeit somewhat weak. In other words, higher income is only weakly associated to higher debt. Observe also that the correlation coefficient between the two explanatory variables, credit_limit and income, is 0.792. A useful property of the correlation coefficient is that it is invariant to linear transformations; this means that the correlation between two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), will be the same as the correlation between \\((a\\cdot x + b)\\) and \\(y\\) for any constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). To illustrate this, observe that the correlation coefficient between income in thousands of dollars and credit card debt was 0.464. If we now find the correlation income in dollars, by multiplying income by 1000, and credit card debt we get: credit_ch6 |&gt; get_correlation(debt ~ 1000 * income) cor 0.464 The correlation is exactly the same. We return to our exploratory data analysis of the multiple regression. The plots in Figure 6.5 and the corresponding the response and each of the explanatory variables separately. In Figure 6.6 we show a 3-dimensional (3D) scatterplot representing the joint relationship of all three variables simultaneously. Each of the 400 observations in the credit_ch6 data frame are marked with a blue point where The response variable \\(y\\), debt, is on the vertical axis. The regressors \\(x_1\\), income, and \\(x_2\\), credit_limit, are on the two axes that form the bottom plane. FIGURE 6.6: 3D scatterplot and regression plane. In addition, Figure 6.6 includes a regression plane. Recall from Subsection 5.3.2 that the linear regression with one numerical explanatory variable selects the “best-fitting” line: the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. When linear regression is performed with two numerical explanatory variables, the solution is a “best-fitting” plane: the plane that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. Visit this website to open an interactive version of this plot in your browser. Learning check (LC6.2) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same outcome variable \\(y\\) debt but with credit_rating and age as the new explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). What can you say about the relationship between a credit card holder’s debt and their credit rating and age? 6.2.2 Multiple regression with two numerical regressors As shown in Figure 6.6, the linear regression with two numerical regressors produces the “best-fitting” plane. We start with a model with no interactions for the two numerical explanatory variables income and credit_limit. In R we consider a model fit with a formula of the form y ~ x1 + x2. We obtain the regression coefficients using the lm() function and the command coef() to obtain the coefficients of the linear regression. The regression coefficients are shown in what follows. debt_model &lt;- lm(debt ~ credit_limit + income, data = credit_ch6) coef(debt_model) We present these results on a table with the mathematical notation used above: Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 -385.179 credit_limit b1 0.264 income b2 -7.663 We obtain the linear regression coefficients using lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data) where x1 and x2 are the two numerical explanatory variables used. We extract the coefficients from the output using the coef() command. We interpret the coefficients obtained. The intercept value is -$385.179. If the range of values that the regressors could take include a credit_limit of $0 and an income of $0, the intercept would represent the average credit card debt for an individual with those levels of credit_limit and income. This is not the case in our data and the intercept has no practical interpretation; it is mainly used to determine where the plane should cut the \\(y\\)-intercept to produce the smallest sum of squared residuals. Each slope in a multiple linear regression is considered a partial slope and represents the marginal or additional contribution of a regressor when it is added to a model that already contains other regressors. This partial slope is typically different than the slope we may find in a simple linear regression for the same regressor. The reason is that, typically, regressors are correlated, so when one regressor is part of a model, indirectly it’s also explaining part of the other regressor. When the second regressor is added to the model, it helps explain only changes in the response that were not already accounted for by the first regressor. For example, the slope for credit_limit is $0.264. Keeping income fixed to some value, for an additional increase of credit limit by one dollar the credit debt increases, on average, by $0.264. Similarly the slope of income is -$7.663. Keeping credit_limit fixed to some level, for a one unit increase of income ($1000 in actual income), there is an associated decrease of $7.66 in credit card debt, on average. Putting these results together, the equation of the regression plane that gives us fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) = \\(\\widehat{\\text{debt}}\\) is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + b_2 \\cdot x_2\\\\ &amp;= -385.179 + 0.263 \\cdot x_1 - 7.663 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(x_1\\) represents credit limit and \\(x_2\\) income. To illustrate the role of partial slopes further, observe that the right plot in Figure 6.5 shows the relationship between debt and income in isolation, a positive relationship, so the slope of income is positive. We can obtain the value of this slope by constructing a simple linear regression using income as the only regressor: # Fit regression model: simple_model &lt;- lm(debt ~ income, data = credit_ch6) # Get the coefficients of the model coef(simple_model) Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0’ 246.51 income b2’ 6.05 The regression line is given by the following with the coefficients denoted using the prime (’) designation since they are different values than what we saw previously \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= b_0&#39; + b_2&#39; \\cdot x_2\\\\ &amp;= 246.515 + 6.048 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(x_2\\) is income. By contrast, when credit_limit and income are considered jointly to explain changes in debt, the equation for the multiple linear regression was: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + b_2 \\cdot x_2\\\\ &amp;= -385.179 + 0.263 \\cdot x_1 - 7.663 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] So the slope for income in a simple linear regression is 6.048, and the slope for income in a multiple linear regression is \\(-7.663\\). As surprising as these results may appear at first, they are perfectly valid and consistent as the slope of a simple linear regression has a different role than the partial slope of a multiple linear regression. The latter is the additional effect of income on debt when credit_limit has already been taken into account. Learning check (LC6.3) Fit a new simple linear regression using lm(debt ~ credit_rating + age, data = credit_ch6) where credit_rating and age are the new numerical explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” regression plane from the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your previous exploratory data analysis? 6.2.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals As shown in Subsection 6.1.4 for the UN member states example, we find the fitted values and residuals for our credit card debt regression model. The fitted values for the credit card debt, \\(\\widehat{\\text{debt}}\\), are computed using the equation for the regression plane obtained in the previous section: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= -385.179 + 0.263 \\cdot x_1 - 7.663 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(x_1\\) is credit_limit and \\(x_2\\) is income. The residuals are the difference between the observed credit card debt and the fitted credit card debt, \\(y - \\widehat y\\), for each observation in the data set. In R, we find the fitted values, debt_hat, and residuals, residual, using the get_regression_points() function. In Table 6.8 we present the first 10 rows of output. Remember that the coordinates of each of the points in our 3D scatterplot in Figure 6.6 can be found in the income, credit_limit, and debt columns. get_regression_points(debt_model) TABLE 6.8: Regression points (First 10 credit card holders out of 400) ID debt credit_limit income debt_hat residual 1 333 3606 14.9 454 -120.8 2 903 6645 106.0 559 344.3 3 580 7075 104.6 683 -103.4 4 964 9504 148.9 986 -21.7 5 331 4897 55.9 481 -150.0 6 1151 8047 80.2 1127 23.6 7 203 3388 21.0 349 -146.4 8 872 7114 71.4 948 -76.0 9 279 3300 15.1 371 -92.2 10 1350 6819 71.1 873 477.3 6.3 Conclusion 6.3.1 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. 6.3.2 What’s to come? This chapter concludes the “Statistical/Data Modeling with moderndive” portion of this book. We are ready to proceed to Part III: “Statistical Inference with infer.” Statistical inference is the science of inferring about some unknown quantity using sampling. So far, we have only studied the regression coefficients and their interpretation. In future chapters we learn how we can use information obtained from a sample to make inferences about the entire population. Once we have covered Chapters 7 on sampling, 8 on confidence intervals, and 9 on hypothesis testing, we revisit the regression models in Chapter 10 on inference for regression. This will complete the topics we want to cover in this book, as shown in Figure 6.7! Furthermore in Chapter 10, we revisit the concept of residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) and discuss their importance when interpreting the results of a regression model. We perform what is known as a residual analysis of the residual variable of all get_regression_points() outputs. Residual analyses allow you to verify what are known as the conditions for inference for regression. FIGURE 6.7: ModernDive flowchart - on to Part III!

This chapter is about sampling. Sampling involves drawing repeated random samples from a population. In Section 7.1 we illustrate sampling by working with samples of white and red balls and the proportion of red balls in these samples. In Section 7.2 we present a theoretical framework and define what is the sampling distribution. We introduce one of the fundamental theoretical results in Statistics: the Central Limit Theorem in Section 7.3. In Section 7.4 we present a second sampling activity, this time working with samples of chocolate-covered almonds and the average weight of these samples. In Section 7.5 we present the sampling distribution in other scenarios. The concepts behind sampling form the basis of inferential methods, in particular confidence intervals and hypothesis tests; methods that are studied in Chapters 8 and 9. Needed Packages If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(infer) Recall that loading the tidyverse package loads many packages that we have encountered earlier. For details refer to Section 4.4. The packages moderndive and infer contain functions and data frames that will be used in this chapter. 7.1 First Activity: Red Balls Take a look at the bowl in Figure 7.1. It has red and white balls of equal size. The balls have been mixed beforehand and there does not seem to be any particular pattern for the location of red and white balls inside the bowl. FIGURE 7.1: A bowl with red and white balls. 7.1.1 The proportion of red balls in the bowl We are interested in finding the proportion of red balls in the bowl. To find this proportion, we could count the number of red balls and divide this number by the total number of balls. The bowl seen in Figure 7.1 is represented virtually by the data frame bowl included in the moderndive package. The first ten rows are shown here for illustration purposes: bowl # A tibble: 2,400 × 2 ball_ID color &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 white 2 2 white 3 3 white 4 4 red 5 5 white 6 6 white 7 7 red 8 8 white 9 9 red 10 10 white # ℹ 2,390 more rows The bowl has 2400 rows representing the 2400 balls in the bowl shown in Figure 7.1. You can view and scroll through the entire contents of the bowl in RStudio’s data viewer by running View(bowl). The first variable ball_ID is used as an identification variable as discussed in Subsection 1.4.4; none of the balls in the actual bowl are marked with numbers. The second variable color indicates whether a particular virtual ball is red or white. We compute the proportion of red balls in the bowl using the dplyr data wrangling verbs presented in Chapter 3. A few steps are needed in order to obtain this proportion. We present these steps separately to remind you how they work but later introduce all the steps together and simplify some of the code. First, for each of the balls, we identify if it is red or not using a test for equality with the logical operator ==. We do this by using the mutate() function from Section 3.5 that allows us to create a new Boolean variable called is_red. bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 2,400 × 3 ball_ID color is_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; 1 1 white FALSE 2 2 white FALSE 3 3 white FALSE 4 4 red TRUE 5 5 white FALSE 6 6 white FALSE 7 7 red TRUE 8 8 white FALSE 9 9 red TRUE 10 10 white FALSE # ℹ 2,390 more rows The variable is_red returns the Boolean (logical) value TRUE for each row where color == \"red\" and FALSE for every row where color is not equal to \"red\". Since R treats TRUE like the number 1 and FALSE like the number 0, accounting for TRUEs and FALSEs is equivalent to working with 1’s and 0’s. In particular, adding all the 1’s and 0’s is equivalent to counting how many red balls are in the bowl. We compute this using the sum() function inside the summarize() function. Recall from Section 3.3 that summarize() takes a data frame with many rows and returns a data frame with a single row containing summary statistics such as the sum(): bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) |&gt; summarize(num_red = sum(is_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 num_red &lt;int&gt; 1 900 The sum() has added all the 1’s and 0’s and has effectively counted the number of red balls. There are 900 red balls in the bowl. Since the bowl contains 2400 balls, the proportion of red balls is 900/2400 = 0.375. We could ask R to obtain the proportion directly by replacing the sum() for the mean() function inside summarize(). The average of 1’s and 0’s is precisely the proportion of red balls in the bowl: bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(is_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 prop_red &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375 This code works well but can be simplified once more. Instead of creating a new Boolean variable is_red before finding the proportion, we could write both steps simultaneously in a single line of code: bowl |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 prop_red &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375 This type of calculation will be used often in the next subsections. 7.1.2 Manual sampling In the previous subsection we were able to obtain the proportion of red balls in the bowl using R only because we had the information of the entire bowl as a data frame. Otherwise, we would have to obtain this manually. If the bowl contained a large number of balls, this could be a long and tedious process. How long do you think it would take to do this manually if the bowl had tens of thousands of balls? Or millions? Or even more? In real-life situations, we are often interested in finding the proportion of a very large number of objects, or subjects, and obtaining an exhaustive count could be tedious, costly, impractical, or even impossible. Because of these limitations, we typically do not perform exhaustive counts. Rather, for this balls example, we randomly select a sample of balls from the bowl, find the proportion of red balls in this sample, and use this proportion to learn more about the proportion of red balls in the entire bowl. One sample We start by inserting a shovel into the bowl as seen in Figure 7.2 and collect \\(5 \\cdot 10 = 50\\) balls as shown in Figure 7.3. The set of balls obtained is called a sample. FIGURE 7.2: Inserting a shovel into the bowl. FIGURE 7.3: Taking a sample of 50 balls from the bowl. Observe that 17 of the balls are red, and thus the proportion of red balls in the sample is 17/50 = 0.34 or 34%. Compare this to the proportion of red balls in the entire bowl, 0.375, that we obtained in Subsection 7.1.1. The proportion obtained from the sample seems actually pretty good, and it did not take much time or energy to obtain. But, was this approximate proportion just a lucky outcome? Could we be this lucky the next time we take a sample from the bowl? In the next subsection we take more samples from the bowl and obtain the proportions of red balls. Thirty-three samples We now take many more random samples as shown in Figure 7.4. Each time we do the following: Return the 50 balls used earlier back into the bowl and mix the contents of the bowl. This is done to ensure that each new sample is not influenced in any way by the previous sample. Take a new sample with the shovel and obtain a new proportion of red balls. FIGURE 7.4: Repeating sampling activity. When we perform this activity many times, we observe that different samples may produce different proportions of red balls. A proportion of red balls obtained from a sample is called a sample proportion. A group of 33 students performed this activity previously and drew a histogram using blocks to represent sample proportions of red balls. Figure 7.5 shows students working on the histogram with two blocks drawn already representing the first two sample proportions obtained and the third about to be added. FIGURE 7.5: Students drawing a histogram of sample proportions. Recall from Section 2.5 that histograms help us visualize the distribution of a numerical variable. In particular, where the center of the values falls and how the values vary. A histogram of the first 10 sample proportions can be seen in Figure 7.6. FIGURE 7.6: Hand-drawn histogram of 10 sample proportions. By looking at the histogram, we observe that the lowest proportion of red balls obtained was between 0.20 and 0.25 while the highest was between 0.45 and 0.5. More importantly, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 0.30 and 0.35. This activity performed by 33 students has the results stored in the tactile_prop_red data frame included in the moderndive package. The first 10 rows are printed below: tactile_prop_red # A tibble: 33 × 4 group replicate red_balls prop_red &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Ilyas, Yohan 1 21 0.42 2 Morgan, Terrance 2 17 0.34 3 Martin, Thomas 3 21 0.42 4 Clark, Frank 4 21 0.42 5 Riddhi, Karina 5 18 0.36 6 Andrew, Tyler 6 19 0.38 7 Julia 7 19 0.38 8 Rachel, Lauren 8 11 0.22 9 Daniel, Caroline 9 15 0.3 10 Josh, Maeve 10 17 0.34 # ℹ 23 more rows Observe that for each student group the data frame provides their names, the number of red_balls observed in the sample, and the calculated proportion of red balls in the sample, prop_red. We also have a replicate variable enumerating each of the 33 groups. We chose this name because each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated (in other words “repeated”) activity. Using again the R data visualization techniques introduced in Chapter 2, we construct the histogram for all 33 sample proportions as shown in Figure 7.7. Recall that each student has obtained a sample of 50 balls using the same procedure and has calculated the proportion of red balls in each sample. The histogram is built using only those sample proportions. We do not need the individual information of each student or the number of red balls obtained. We constructed the histogram using ggplot() with geom_histogram(). To align the bins in the computerized histogram version so it matches the hand-drawn histogram shown in Figure 7.6, the arguments boundary = 0.4 and binwidth = 0.05 were used. The former indicates that we want a binning scheme, such that, one of the bins’ boundaries is at 0.4; the latter fixes the width of the bin to 0.05 units. ggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of red balls in each sample&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 33 proportions&quot;) FIGURE 7.7: The distribution of sample proportions based on 33 random samples of size 50. When studying the histogram we can see that some proportions are lower than 25% and others are greater than 45%, but most of the sample proportions obtained are between 30% and 45%. We can also use this activity to introduce some statistical terminology. The process of taking repeated samples of 50 balls and obtaining the corresponding sample proportions is called sampling. Since we returned the observed balls to the bowl before getting another sample, we say that we performed sampling with replacement and because we mixed the balls before taking a new sample, the samples were randomly drawn and are called random samples. As shown in Figure 7.7, different random samples produce different sample proportions. This phenomenon is called sampling variation. Furthermore, the histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of sample proportions, it describes the sample proportions that have been obtained and how often they appear. The distribution of all possible sample proportions that can be obtained from random samples is called, appropriately, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. The sampling distribution is central to the ideas we develop in this chapter. Learning check (LC7.1) Why is it important to mix the balls in the bowl before we take a new sample? (LC7.2) Why is it that students did not all have the same sample proportion of red balls? 7.1.3 Virtual sampling In the previous Subsection 7.1.2, we performed a tactile sampling activity: students took physical samples using a real shovel from a bowl with white and red balls by hand. We now extend the entire process using simulations on a computer, a sort of virtual sampling activity. The use of simulations permits us to study not only 33 random samples but thousands, tens of thousands, or even more samples. When a large number of random samples is obtained, we can gain a better understanding of the sampling distribution and the sampling variation of sample proportions. In addition, we are not limited by samples of 50 balls, as we can simulate sampling with any desired sample size. We are going to do all this in this subsection. We start by mimicking our manual activity. One virtual sample Recall that the bowl seen in Figure 7.1 is represented by the data frame bowl included in the moderndive package. The virtual analog to the 50-ball shovel seen in Figure 7.2 can be obtained using the rep_slice_sample() function included in the moderndive package. This function allows us to take repeated (or replicated) random samples of size n. We start by obtaining a single sample of 50 balls: virtual_shovel &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50) virtual_shovel # A tibble: 50 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ball_ID color &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 1970 white 2 1 842 red 3 1 2287 white 4 1 599 white 5 1 108 white 6 1 846 red 7 1 390 red 8 1 344 white 9 1 910 white 10 1 1485 white # ℹ 40 more rows Observe that virtual_shovel has 50 rows corresponding to our virtual sample of size 50. The ball_ID variable identifies which of the 2400 balls from bowl are included in our sample of 50 balls while color denotes its whether white or red. The replicate variable is equal to 1 for all 50 rows because we have decided to take only one sample right now. Later on, we take more samples, and replicate will take more values. We compute the proportion of red balls in our virtual sample. The code we use is similar to the one used for finding the proportion of red balls in the entire bowl in Subsection 7.1.1: virtual_shovel |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 Based on this random sample, 24% of the virtual_shovel’s 50 balls were red! We proceed finding the sample proportion for more random samples. Thirty-three virtual samples In Section 7.1, students got 33 samples and sample proportions. They repeated/replicated the sampling process 33 times. We do this virtually by again using the function rep_slice_sample() and this time adding the reps = 33 argument as we want to obtain 33 random samples. We save these samples in the data frame virtual_samples, as shown below, and then provide a preview of its first 10 rows. If you want to inspect the entire virtual_samples data frame, use RStudio’s data viewer by running View(virtual_samples). virtual_samples &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 33) virtual_samples # A tibble: 1,650 × 3 # Groups: replicate [33] replicate ball_ID color &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 1970 white 2 1 842 red 3 1 2287 white 4 1 599 white 5 1 108 white 6 1 846 red 7 1 390 red 8 1 344 white 9 1 910 white 10 1 1485 white # ℹ 1,640 more rows Observe in the data viewer that the first 50 rows of replicate are equal to 1, the next 50 rows of replicate are equal to 2, and so on. The first 50 rows correspond to the first sample of 50 balls while the next 50 rows correspond to the second sample of 50 balls. This pattern continues for all reps = 33 replicates, and thus virtual_samples has 33 \\(\\cdot\\) 50 = 1650 rows. Using virtual_samples we obtain the proportion of red balls for each replicate. We use the same dplyr verbs as before. In particular, we add group_by() of the replicate variable. Recall from Section 3.4 that by assigning the grouping variable “meta-data” before summarize(), we perform the calculations needed for each replicate separately. The other line of code, as explained in the case of one sample, calculates the sample proportion of red balls. A preview of the first 10 rows is presented below: virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples |&gt; group_by(replicate) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_red # A tibble: 33 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 2 2 0.46 3 3 0.38 4 4 0.36 5 5 0.38 6 6 0.3 7 7 0.42 8 8 0.42 9 9 0.32 10 10 0.48 # ℹ 23 more rows Actually, the function rep_slice_sample() already groups the data by replicate, so it is not necessary to include group_by() in the code. Moreover, using dplyr pipes in R we could simplify the work and write everything at once: using rep_slice_sample(), we obtain 33 replicates (each being a random sample of 50 balls) and using summarize() with mean() on the Boolean values, we obtain the proportion of red balls for each sample. We store these proportions on the data frame virtual_prop_red and print the first 10 sample proportions (for the first 10 samples) as an illustration: virtual_prop_red &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 33) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_red # A tibble: 33 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 2 2 0.46 3 3 0.38 4 4 0.36 5 5 0.38 6 6 0.3 7 7 0.42 8 8 0.42 9 9 0.32 10 10 0.48 # ℹ 23 more rows As was the case in the tactile activity, there is sampling variation in the resulting 33 proportions obtained from the virtual samples. As we did manually in Subsection 7.1.3, we construct a histogram with these sample proportions as shown in Figure 7.8. The histogram helps us visualize the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. Observe again the histogram was constructed using ggplot(), geom_histogram(), and including the arguments binwidth = 0.05 and boundary = 0.4. ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample proportion&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 33 sample proportions&quot;) FIGURE 7.8: The distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 virtual samples of size 50. When observing the histogram we can see that some proportions are lower than 25% and others are greater than 45%. Also, the sample proportions observed more frequently are between 35% and 40% (for 11 out of 33 samples). We have obtained similar results when sampling was done by hand in Subsection 7.1.2, and the histogram was presented in Figure 7.7. We present both histograms side by side in Figure 7.9 for an easy comparison. Note that they are somewhat similar in their center and variation, although not identical. The differences are also due to sampling variation. FIGURE 7.9: The sampling distribution of the sample proportion and sampling variation: showing a histogram for virtual sample proportions (left) and another histogram for tactile sample proportions (right). Learning check (LC7.3) Why couldn’t we study the effects of sampling variation when we used the virtual shovel only once? Why did we need to take more than one virtual sample (in our case, 33 virtual samples)? One thousand virtual samples It was helpful to observe how sampling variation affects sample proportions in 33 samples. It was also interesting to note that while the 33 virtual samples provide different sample proportions than the 33 physical samples, the overall patterns were fairly similar. Because the samples were obtained at random in both cases, any other set of 33 samples, virtual or physical, would provide a different set of sample proportions due to sampling variation, but the overall patterns would still be similar. Still, 33 samples are not enough to fully understand these patterns. This is why we now study the sampling distribution and the effects of sampling variation with 1000 random samples. Trying to do this manually could be impractical but obtaining virtual samples can be done quickly and efficiently. Additionally, we have already developed the tools for this. We repeat the steps performed earlier using the rep_slice_sample() function with a sample size set to be 50. This time however, we set the number of replicates reps to 1000, and use summarize() and mean() again on the Boolean values to obtain the sample proportions. We obtain virtual_prop_red with the count of red balls and the corresponding sample proportion for all 1000 random samples. The proportions for the first 10 samples are shown below: virtual_prop_red &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_red # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 2 2 0.46 3 3 0.38 4 4 0.36 5 5 0.38 6 6 0.3 7 7 0.42 8 8 0.42 9 9 0.32 10 10 0.48 # ℹ 990 more rows As we did before, we construct a histogram for these 1000 sample proportions. It is shown in Figure 7.10. ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample proportion&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 1000 sample proportions&quot;) FIGURE 7.10: The distribution of 1000 proportions based on 1000 random samples of size 50. The sample proportions represented by the histogram could be as low as 15% or as high as 60%, but those extreme proportions are rare. The most frequent proportions obtained are those between 35% and 40%. Furthermore, the histogram now shows a symmetric and bell-shaped distribution that can be approximated well by a normal distribution. Please read the “Normal distribution” section (Appendix A.2) for a brief discussion of this distribution and its properties. Learning check (LC7.4) Why did we not take 1000 “tactile” samples of 50 balls by hand? (LC7.5) Looking at Figure 7.10, would you say that sampling 50 balls where 30% of them were red is likely or not? What about sampling 50 balls where 10% of them were red? Different sample sizes Another advantage of using simulations is that we can also study how the sampling distribution of the sample proportion changes if we obtain the sample proportions from samples smaller than or larger than 50 balls. We do need to be careful to not mix results though: we build the sampling distribution using sample proportions obtained from samples of the same size, but the size chosen does not have to be 50 balls. We must first decide the sample size we want to use, and then obtain samples using that size. As an illustration, we can perform the sampling activity three times, for each activity using a different sample size, think of having three shovels of sizes 25, 50, and 100 as shown in Figure 7.11. Of course, we do this virtually: with each shovel size we gather many random samples, calculate the corresponding sample proportions, and plot those proportions in a histogram. Therefore we obtain three histograms, each one describing the sampling distribution for sample proportions obtained from samples of size 25, 50, and 100, respectively. As we show later in this subsection, the size of the sample has a direct effect on the sampling distribution and the magnitude of its sampling variation. FIGURE 7.11: Three shovels to extract three different sample sizes. We follow the same process performed previously: we generate 1000 samples, obtain the sample proportions, and use them to draw a histogram. We follow this process three different times, setting the size argument in the code equal to 25, 50, and 100, respectively. We run each of the following code segments individually and then compare the resulting histograms. # Segment 1: sample size = 25 ------------------------------ # 1.a) Compute sample proportions for 1000 samples, each sample of size 25 virtual_prop_red_25 &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 25, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # 1.b) Plot a histogram to represent the distribution of the sample proportions ggplot(virtual_prop_red_25, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 25 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;25&quot;) # Segment 2: sample size = 50 ------------------------------ # 2.a) Compute sample proportions for 1000 samples, each sample of size 50 virtual_prop_red_50 &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # 2.b) Plot a histogram to represent the distribution of the sample proportions ggplot(virtual_prop_red_50, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 50 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;50&quot;) # Segment 3: sample size = 100 ------------------------------ # 2.a) Compute sample proportions for 1000 samples, each sample of size 100 virtual_prop_red_100 &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 100, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # 3.b) Plot a histogram to represent the distribution of the sample proportions ggplot(virtual_prop_red_100, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 100 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;100&quot;) For easy comparison, we present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes in Figure 7.12. FIGURE 7.12: Histograms of sample proportions for different sample sizes. Observe that all three histograms are: centered around the same middle value, which appears to be a value slightly below 0.4, are somewhat bell-shaped, and exhibit sampling variation that is different for each sample size. In particular, as the sample size increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the sample proportions do not vary as much and they seem to get closer to the middle value. These are important characteristic of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion: the first observation relates to the shape of the distribution, the second to the center of the distribution, and the last one to the sampling variation and how it is affected by the sample size. These results are not coincidental or isolated to the example of sample proportions of red balls in a bowl. In the next subsection, a theoretical framework is introduced that helps explain with precise mathematical equations the behavior of sample proportions obtained from random samples. Learning check (LC7.6) As shown in Figure 7.12 the histograms of sample proportions are somewhat bell-shaped. What can you say about the center of the histograms? A. The larger the sample size the greater the center of the histogram. B. The larger the sample size the smaller the center of the histogram. C. The center of each histogram seems to be about the same, regardless of the sample size. (LC7.7) As shown in Figure 7.12 as the sample size increases, the histogram gets narrower. What happens with the sample proportions? A. They vary less. B. They vary by the same amount. C. They vary more. 7.2 Sampling Framework In Section 7.1 we gained some intuition about sampling and its characteristics. In this section we introduce some statistical definitions and terminology related to sampling. We conclude by introducing key characteristics that will be formally studied in the rest of the chapter. 7.2.1 Population, sample, and the sampling distribution A population or study population is a collection of all individuals or observations of interest. In the bowl activities the population is the collection of all the balls in the bowl. A sample is a subset of the population. Sampling is the act of collecting samples from the population. Simple random sampling is sampling where each member of the population has the same chance of being selected, for example, by using a shovel to select balls from a bowl. A random sample is a sample obtained using simple random sampling. In the bowl activities, physical and virtual, we use simple random sampling to obtain random samples from the bowl. A population parameter (or simply a parameter) is a numerical summary (a number) that represents some characteristic of the population. A sample statistic (or simply a statistic) is a numerical summary computed from a sample. In the bowl activities the parameter of interest was the population proportion \\(p=\\) 0.375. Similarly, previously a sample of 50 balls was obtained and 17 were red. A statistic is the sample proportion which in this example was equal to \\(\\widehat{p}= 0.34\\). Observe how we use \\(p\\) to represent the population proportion (parameter) and \\(\\widehat{p}\\) for the sample proportion (statistic). The distribution of a list of numbers is the set of the possible values in the list and how often they occur. The sampling distribution of the sample proportion is the distribution of sample proportions obtained from each possible random samples of a given size. To illustrate this concept recall that in Subsection 7.1.3 we obtained three histograms shown in Figure 7.12. The histogram on the left, for example, was constructed by obtaining 1000 random samples of size \\(n=25\\), then finding the sample proportion for each sample and using these proportions to draw the histogram. This histogram is a good visual approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. The sampling distribution can be a difficult concept to grasp right away: The sampling distribution of the sample proportion is the distribution of sample proportions; it is constructed using exclusively sample proportions. Be careful as people learning this terminology sometimes confuse the term sampling distribution with a sample’s distribution. The latter can be understood as the distribution of the values in a given sample. A histogram obtained from a simulation of sample proportions is only a visual approximation of the sampling distribution. It is not the exact distribution. Still, when the simulations produce a large number of sample proportions, the resulting histogram provides a good approximation of the sampling distribution. This was the case in Subsection 7.1.3 and the three histograms shown in Figure 7.12. The lessons we learned by performing the activities in Section 7.1 contribute to gaining insights about key characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, namely: The center of the sampling distribution The effect of sampling variation on the sampling distribution and the effect of the sample size on this sampling variation The shape of the sampling distribution The first two points relate to measures of central tendency and dispersion, respectively. The last one provides a connection to one of the most important theorems in statistics: the Central Limit Theorem. In the next section, we formally study these characteristics. 7.3 The Central Limit Theorem A fascinating result in statistics is that, when obtaining random samples from any population, the corresponding sample means follow a typical behavior: their histogram is bell-shaped and has very unique features. This is true regardless of the distribution of the population values and forms the basis of what we know as the Central Limit Theorem. Before fully describing it, we introduce a theoretical framework to construct this and other characteristics related to sampling. 7.3.1 Random variables A simple theoretical framework can help us formalize important properties of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. To do this we modify the bowl activity slightly. Instead of using a shovel to select all 25 balls at once, we randomly select one ball at a time, 25 times. If the ball is red we call it a success and record a 1 (one); if it is not red we call it a failure and record a 0 (zero). Then, we return the ball to the bowl so the proportion of red balls in the bowl doesn’t change. This process is called a trial or a Bernoulli trial in honor of Jacob Bernoulli, a 17th-century mathematician who is among the first ones to work with these trials. Getting a sample of 25 balls is running 25 trials and obtaining 25 numbers, ones or zeros, representing whether or not we have observed red balls on each trial, respectively. The average of these 25 numbers (zeros or ones) represents precisely the proportion or red balls in a sample of 25 balls. It is useful to represent a trial as a random variable. We use the uppercase letter \\(X\\) and the subscript \\(1\\) as \\(X_1\\) to denote the random variable for the first trial. After the first trial is completed, so the color of the first ball is observed, the value of \\(X_1\\) is realized as 1 if the ball is red or 0 if the ball is white. For example, if the first ball is red, we write \\(X_1 = 1\\). Similarly we use \\(X_2\\) to represent the second trial. For example, if the second ball is white, \\(X_2\\) is realized as \\(X_2=0\\), and so on. \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), \\(\\dots\\) are random variables only before the trials have been performed. After the trials, they are just the ones or zeros representing red or white balls, respectively. Moreover, since our experiment is to perform 25 trials and then find the average of them, this average or mean, before the trials are carried out, can also be expressed as a random variable: \\[\\overline X = \\frac{X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_{25}}{25}.\\] Here \\(\\overline X\\) is the random variable that represents the average, or mean, of these 25 trials. This is why we call \\(\\overline X\\) the sample mean. Again, \\(\\overline X\\) is a random variable before the 25 trials have been performed. After the trials, \\(\\overline X\\) is realized as the average of 25 zeros and ones. For example, if the results of the trials are: \\[\\{0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1 \\}\\] The observed value of \\(\\overline X\\) will be \\[\\overline X = \\frac{0+0+0+1+0+1+\\dots+1+0+0+0+1}{25} = \\frac{10}{25}=0.4.\\] So, for this particular example, the sample mean is \\(\\overline X = 0.4\\) which happens to be the sample proportion of red balls in this sample of 25 balls. In the context of Bernoulli trials, because we are finding averages of zeros and ones, these sample means are sample proportions! Connecting with the notation used earlier, observe that after the trials have been completed, \\(\\overline X = \\widehat{p}\\). 7.3.2 The sampling distribution using random variables Suppose that we want to obtain the sample proportion for another random sample of 25 balls. In terms of the random variable \\(\\overline X\\), this is performing 25 trials and obtaining another 25 values, ones and zeros, for \\(X_1\\), $X_2, \\(\\dots\\), \\(X_{25}\\) and finding their average. For example we might get: \\[\\{1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0\\}\\] Then, the realization of \\(\\overline X\\) will be \\(\\overline X = 9/25 = 0.36\\). This sample proportion was different than the one obtained earlier, 0.4. The possible values of \\(\\overline X\\) are the possible proportions of red balls for a sample of 25 balls. In other words, the value that \\(\\overline X\\) takes after the trials have been completed is the sample proportion for the observed sample of red and white balls. Moreover, while any given trial can result in choosing a red ball or not (1 or 0), the chances or getting a red ball are influenced by the proportion of red balls in the bowl. For example, if a bowl has more red balls than white, the chances of getting a red ball on any given trial are higher than getting a white ball. Because 1 is the realization of a trial when a red ball is observed, the sample proportion also would tend to be higher. Sampling variation does produce different sample proportions for different random samples, but they are influenced by the proportion of red and white balls in the bowl. This is why understanding the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is learning which sample proportions are possible and which proportions are more or less likely to be observed. Since the realization of \\(\\overline X\\) is the observed sample proportion, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is precisely the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). In the rest of this section, we use both expressions interchangeably. We recall the key characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, now in terms of \\(\\overline X\\): The center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) The effect of sampling variation on the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) and the effect of the sample size on sampling variation The shape of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) To address these points, we use simulations. Simulations seldom provide the exact structure of the distribution, because an infinite number of samples may be needed for this. A large number of replications often produces a really good approximation of the distribution though and can be used to understand well the distribution’s characteristics. Let’s use the output obtained in Subsection 7.1.3; namely, the sample proportions for samples of size 25, 50, and 100. If we focus on size 25, think of each sample proportion from samples of size 25 as a possible value of \\(\\overline X\\). We now use these sample proportions to illustrate properties of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. 7.3.3 The center of the distribution: the expected value Since the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) is composed of all the sample proportions that can be obtained for a given sample size, the center of this distribution can be understood as the average of all these proportions. This is the value we would expect to get, on average, from all these sample proportions. This is why the center value of the sampling distribution is called the expected value of the sample proportion, and we write \\(E(\\overline X)\\). Based on probability theory, the mean of \\(\\overline X\\) happens to be equal to the population proportion of red balls in the bowl. In Subsection 7.1.1 we determined that the population proportion was 900/2400 = 0.375, therefore \\[E(\\overline X) = p = 0.375.\\] As an illustration, we noted in Subsection 7.1.3 when looking at the histograms in Figure 7.12 that all three histograms were centered at some value between 0.35 and 0.4 (or between 35% and 40%). As we have established now, they are centered exactly at the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\), which is the population proportion. Figure 7.13 displays these histograms again, but this time adds a vertical red line on each of them at the location of the population proportion value, \\(p\\) = 0.375. FIGURE 7.13: Three sampling distributions with population proportion \\(p\\) marked by vertical line. The results shown seem to agree with the theory. We can further check, using the simulation results, by finding the average of the 1,000 sample proportions obtained. We start with the histogram on the left: virtual_prop_red_25 # A tibble: 1,000 × 3 replicate prop_red n &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 0.32 25 2 2 0.24 25 3 3 0.16 25 4 4 0.32 25 5 5 0.44 25 6 6 0.36 25 7 7 0.32 25 8 8 0.36 25 9 9 0.2 25 10 10 0.32 25 # ℹ 990 more rows virtual_prop_red_25 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_25 = mean(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 E_Xbar_25 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.377 The variable prop_red in data frame virtual_prop_red_25 contains the sample proportions for each of the 1,000 samples obtained. The average of these sample proportion is presented as object E_Xbar_25 which represents the estimated expected value of \\(\\overline X\\), by using the average of the 1,000 sample proportions. Each of the sample proportions is obtained from random samples of 25 balls from the bowl. This average happens to be precisely the same as the population proportion. It is worth spending a moment understanding this result. If we take one random sample of a given size, we know that the sample proportion from this sample would be somewhat different than the population proportion due to sampling variation; however, if we take many random samples of the same size, the average of the sample proportions obtained are expected to be about the same as the population proportion. We present the equivalent results with samples of size 50 and 100: virtual_prop_red_50 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_50 = mean(prop_red)) virtual_prop_red_100 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_100 = mean(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 E_Xbar_50 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.379 # A tibble: 1 × 1 E_Xbar_100 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.377 Indeed, the results obtained are about the same as the population proportion. Do note that the average of 1,000 sample proportions for samples of size 50 was actually 0.379 close to 0.375. This happens because the simulations only approximate the sampling distribution and the expected value. When using simulations we do not expect to obtain the exact theoretical results, rather values that are close enough to support our understanding of the theoretical results. 7.3.4 Sampling variation: standard deviation and standard error Another relevant characteristic observed in Figure 7.13 is how the amount of dispersion or sampling variation changes when the sample size changes. While all the histograms have a similar bell-shaped configuration and are centered at the same value, observe that when… the sample size is \\(n=25\\) (left histogram) the observed sample proportions are about as low as 0.1 and as high as 0.65. the sample size is \\(n=50\\) (middle histogram) the observed sample proportions are about as low as 0.15 and as high as 0.55. the sample size is \\(n=100\\) (right histogram) the observed sample proportions are about as low as 0.20 and as high as 0.5. As the sample size \\(n\\) increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the variation of the sampling distribution decreases. Thus, the values are clustered more and more tightly around the center of the distribution. In other words, the histogram on the left of Figure 7.13 is more spread out than the one in the middle, which in turn is more spread out than the one on the right. We know that the center of the distribution is the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\), which is the population proportion. From this, we can quantify this variation by calculating how far the sample proportions are, on average, from the population proportion. A well-known statistical measurement to quantify dispersion is the standard deviation. We discuss how it works before we continue with the sampling variation problem. The standard deviation We start with an example and introduce some special notation. As an illustration, given four values \\(y_1=3\\), \\(y_2=-1\\), \\(y_3=5\\), and \\(y_4= 9\\), their average is given by \\[\\bar y = \\frac14\\sum_{i=1}^4y_i =\\frac14 (y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4)= \\frac{3-1+5+9}{4}= 2.\\] The capital Greek letter \\(\\Sigma\\) represents the summation of values, and it is useful when a large number of values need to be added. The letter \\(i\\) underneath \\(\\Sigma\\) is the index of summation. It starts at \\(i=1\\), so the first value we are adding is \\(y_{\\bf 1} = 3\\). Afterwards \\(i=2\\), so we add \\(y_{\\bf 2}=-1\\) to our previous result, an so on, as shown in the equation above. The summation symbol can be very useful when adding many numbers or making more complicated operations, such as defining the standard deviation. To construct the standard deviation of a list of values, we first find the deviations of each value from their average, then square those deviations, then find the average of the squared deviations, and take the square root of this average to finish. In our example, the standard deviation is given by \\[SD = \\sqrt{\\frac14\\sum_{i=1}^4(y_i - \\bar y)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(3-2)^2+(-1-2)^2+(5-2)^2+(9-2)^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+9+9+49}{4}}=\\sqrt{17} = 4.12\\] We present another example, this time using R. We use again our bowl activity with red and white balls in the bowl. We create a Boolean variable is_red that corresponds to TRUEs or 1s for red balls and FALSEs or 0s for white balls and using these numbers, we compute the proportion (average of 1s and 0s) using the mean() function and the standard deviation using the sd() function2 inside summarize(): bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = color == &quot;red&quot;) |&gt; summarize(p = mean(is_red), st_dev = sd(is_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 p st_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375 0.484 So, the proportion of red balls is 0.375 with a standard deviation of 0.484. The intuition behind the standard deviation can be expressed as follows: if you were to select many balls, with replacement, from the bowl, we would expect the proportion of red balls to be about 0.375 give or take 0.484. In addition, when dealing with proportions, the formula for the standard deviation can be expressed directly in terms of the population proportion, \\(p\\), using the formula: \\[SD = \\sqrt{p(1-p)}.\\] Here is the value of the standard deviation using this alternative formula in R: p &lt;- 0.375 sqrt(p * (1 - p)) [1] 0.484 The value is the same as using the general formula. Now that we have gained a better understanding of the standard deviation, we can discuss the standard deviation in the context of sampling variation for the sample proportion. The standard error Recall that we want to measure the magnitude of the sampling variation for the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) (the sampling distribution of the sample proportion) and want to use the standard deviation for this purpose. We have shown earlier that the center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) is the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\). In our case, this is the population proportion \\(p = 0.375\\). The standard deviation will then indicate how far, on average, each possible sample proportion roughly is from the population proportion. If we were to consider using a sample proportion as an estimate of the population proportion, this deviation could be considered the error in estimation. Because of this particular relationship, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution receives a special name: the standard error. Note that all standard errors are standard deviations but not all standard deviations are standard errors. We work again with simulations and the bowl of red and white balls. We obtain 10,000 random samples of size \\(n=100\\), obtain the sample proportion for each sample, and calculate the average and standard deviation for these sample proportions. This simulation produces a histogram similar to the one presented on the right in Figure 7.13. To produce this data we again use the rep_slice_sample() function and mean() and sd() function inside summarize() to produce the desired results: bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 10000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) |&gt; summarize(p = mean(prop_red), SE_Xbar = sd(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 p SE_Xbar &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375 0.0479 Observe that p is the estimated expected value and SE_Xbar is the estimated standard error based on the simulation of obtaining sample proportions for random samples of size \\(n=100\\). Compare this value with the standard deviation for the entire bowl, obtained earlier. It is one tenth the size! This is not a coincidence: the standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) is equal to the standard deviation of the population (the bowl) divided by the square root of the sample size. In the case of sample proportions, the standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) can also be obtained using the formula: \\[SE_{\\overline X} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\] where \\(p\\) is the population proportion and \\(n\\) is the size of our sample. This formula shows that the standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size: as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases. In our example, the standard error is \\[SE_{\\overline X} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.375\\cdot(1-0.375)}{100}} = 0.0484\\] p = 0.375 sqrt(p*(1-p)/100) [1] 0.0484 This value is nearly identical to the result obtained on the simulation above. We repeat this exercise, this time finding the estimated standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) from the simulations obtained earlier. These simulations are stored in data frames virtual_prop_red_25 and virtual_prop_red_50, when the sample sizes used are \\(n=25\\) and \\(n=50\\), respectively: virtual_prop_red_25 |&gt; summarize(SE_Xbar_50 = sd(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 SE_Xbar_50 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0971 virtual_prop_red_50 |&gt; summarize(SE_Xbar_100 = sd(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 SE_Xbar_100 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0667 The standard errors for these examples, based on the proportion of red balls in the bowl and the sample sizes, are given below: sqrt(p * (1 - p) / 25) [1] 0.0968 sqrt(p * (1 - p) / 50) [1] 0.0685 The simulations support the standard errors obtained using mathematical formulas. The simulations are used to check that in fact the results obtained agree with the theory. Observe also that the theoretical results are constructed based on the knowledge of the population proportion, \\(p\\); by contrast, the simulations produce samples based on the population of interest but produce results only based on information obtained from samples and sample proportions. The formula for the standard error of the sample proportion given here can actually be derived using facts in probability theory, but its development goes beyond the scope of this book. To learn more about it, please consult more advanced treatments in probability and statistics such as this one. The sampling distribution of the sample proportion So far we have shown some of the properties of the sampling distribution for the sampling proportion; namely, the expected value and standard error of \\(\\overline X\\). We now turn our attention to the shape of the sampling distribution. As mentioned before, histograms (such as those seen earlier) provide a good approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). Since we are interested in the shape of the distribution, we redraw again the histograms obtained using sample proportions from random samples of size \\(n=25\\), \\(n=50\\), and \\(n=100\\), but this time we add a smooth curve that appears to connect the top parts of each bar in the histogram. These histograms are presented in Figures 7.14, 7.15, and 7.16. The figures represent density histograms where the area of each bar represents the percentage or proportion of observations for the corresponding bin and the total area of each histogram is 1 (or 100%). The ranges for the \\(x-\\) and \\(y-\\)axis on all these plots have been kept constant for appropriate comparisons among them. FIGURE 7.14: Histogram of the distribution of the sample proportion and the normal curve. FIGURE 7.15: Histogram of the distribution of the sample proportion and the normal curve. FIGURE 7.16: Histogram of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion and the normal curve. The curves in red seem to be a fairly good representation of the top bars of the histograms. However, we have not used the simulated data to draw these curves, these bell-shaped curves were extracted from the normal distribution with mean equal to \\(p=0.375\\) and standard deviation equal to \\(\\sqrt{{p(1-p)/n}}\\) where \\(n\\) changes for each histogram. This is a fascinating result due to an application of one of the most important results in Statistics: the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that when the sample size, \\(n\\), tends to infinity, the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) tends to the normal distribution (with the appropriate mean and standard deviation). Moreover, it does not depend on the population distribution; the population can be a bowl with red and white balls or anything else. The observant reader may have noticed that, in practice, we cannot take samples of size equal to infinity. What makes the CLT even more relevant for practical purposes is that the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) approximates normality even when the sample size used is fairly small. As you can see in Figure 7.14, even when random samples of size \\(n=25\\) are used, the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) already seems to follow a normal distribution. Observe also that all the curves follow the bell-shaped form of the normal curve but the spread is greater when a smaller sample size has been used and is consistent with the standard error for \\(\\overline X\\) obtained earlier for each case. 7.3.5 Summary We now present a summary of the relevant information learned about the sampling distribution of the sample proportion: The mean of all the sample proportions will be exactly the same as the population proportion. The standard deviation of the sample proportions, also called the standard error, is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size: the larger the sample size used to obtain sample proportions, the closer those sample proportions will be from the population proportion, on average. As long as the random samples used are large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, or simply the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), will approximate the normal distribution. This is true for sample proportions regardless of the structure of the underlying population distribution; that is, regardless of how many red and white balls are in the bowl, or whether you are performing any other experiment that deals with sample proportions. In case you want to reinforce these ideas a little more, Shuyi Chiou, Casey Dunn, and Pathikrit Bhattacharyya created a 3-minute and 38-second video at https://youtu.be/jvoxEYmQHNM explaining this crucial statistical theorem using the average weight of wild bunny rabbits and the average wingspan of dragons as examples. Figure 7.17 shows a preview of this video. FIGURE 7.17: Preview of Central Limit Theorem video. 7.4 Second Activity: Chocolate-Covered Almonds We want to extend the results obtained for the sample proportion to a more general case: the sample mean. In this section we show how most of the results obtained for sample proportions extend directly to sample means, but we also highlight important differences when working with the sampling distribution of the sample mean. As we did with sample proportions, we start by illustrating these results with another activity: sampling from a bowl of chocolate-covered almonds, as seen in Figure 7.18. FIGURE 7.18: A bowl of chocolate-covered almonds. For ease of exposition we refer to each chocolate-covered almond simply as an almond. We are now interested in the average weight in grams of all the almonds in the bowl; this is the population average weight or population mean weight. 7.4.1 The population mean weight of almonds in the bowl The population of interest is given by all the almonds in the bowl. The bowl is represented virtually by the data frame almonds_bowl included in the moderndive package. The first ten rows are shown here for illustration purposes: almonds_bowl # A tibble: 5,000 × 2 ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.8 2 2 4.2 3 3 3.2 4 4 3.1 5 5 4.1 6 6 3.9 7 7 3.4 8 8 4.2 9 9 3.5 10 10 3.4 # ℹ 4,990 more rows The first variable ID represents a virtual ID number given to each almond, and the variable weight contains the weight in grams for each almond in the bowl. The population mean weight of almonds, a population parameter, can be obtained in R using again the dplyr data wrangling verbs presented in Chapter 3. Observe, in particular, inside the function summarize() the use of the mean(), sd(), and n() functions for the mean weight, the weight’s standard deviation3, and the number of almonds in the bowl: almonds_bowl |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), sd_weight = sd(weight), length = n()) # A tibble: 1 × 3 mean_weight sd_weight length &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 3.64 0.392 5000 We have 5,000 almonds in the bowl, the population mean weight is 3.64 grams, and the weight’s standard deviation is 0.392 grams. We used R to obtain the mean and standard deviation, but we could have used the formulas instead. If we call \\(x_1\\) the first almond in the bowl, \\(x_2\\) the second, and so on, the mean is given by \\[\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000}\\frac{x_i}{5000}=3.64.\\] and the standard deviation is given by \\[\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{5000}=0.392.\\] The Greek letters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are used to represent the population mean and population standard deviation (the parameters of interest). In addition, since we know the information of the entire bowl, we can draw the distribution of weights of the entire population (bowl) using a histogram: ggplot(almonds_bowl, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 7.19: Distribution of weights for the entire bowl of almonds. We can see that the weight of almonds ranges from 2.6 to 4.6 grams and the most common weights observed are between 3.6 and 4.0 grams, but the distribution is not symmetric and does not follow any typical pattern. Now that we have a clear understanding of our population of interest and the parameters of interest, we can continue our exploration of the sampling distribution of the sample mean weights of almonds by constructing samples. 7.4.2 Manual sampling and sample means If we randomly select one almond from the bowl, we could determine its weight using a scale, as shown in Figure 7.20 FIGURE 7.20: One almond on a scale. Let’s now obtain a random sample of 25 almonds, as shown in Figure 7.21, and determine the sample average weight, or sample mean weight, in grams. FIGURE 7.21: A random sample of 25 almonds on a scale. Since the total weight is 88.6 grams, as shown in the Figure 7.21, the sample mean weight will be \\(88.6/25 = 3.544\\). The moderndive package contains the information of this sample in the almonds_sample data frame. Here, we present the weight of the first 10 almonds in the sample: almonds_sample &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 25, reps = 1) almonds_sample The almonds_sample data frame in the moderndive package has \\(n=\\) 25 rows corresponding to each almond in the sample shown in Figure 7.21. The first variable replicate indicates this is the first and only replicate since it is a single sample. The second variable ID gives an identification to the particular almond. The third column weight gives the corresponding weight for each almond in grams as a numeric variable, also known as a double (dbl). The distribution of the weights of these 25 are shown in the histogram in Figure 7.22. ggplot(almonds_sample, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 7.22: Distribution of weight on a sample of 25 almonds. The weights of almonds in this sample range from 2.9 to 4.4 grams. There is not an obvious pattern in the distribution of this sample. We now compute the sample mean using our data wrangling tools from Chapter 3. almonds_sample |&gt; summarize(sample_mean_weight = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate sample_mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.67 The sample mean weight was not too far from the population mean weight of 3.64 grams. The difference between the statistic (sample mean weight) and the parameter (population mean weight) was due to sampling variation. 7.4.3 Virtual sampling We now perform sampling virtually. The data frame almonds_bowl has 5000 rows, each representing an almond in the bowl. As we did in Section 7.1.3 we use again the rep_slice_sample() function to obtain 1000 random samples with a sample size set to be 25, and with the number of replicates reps set to 1000.

The sample mean weights observed in the histogram appear to go below 3.4 grams and above 3.85 grams, but those extreme sample means are rare. The most frequent sample means obtained seem to be those above 3.5 or below 3.8 grams. Furthermore, the histogram is almost symmetric and showing that bell-shaped form, although the left tail of the histogram appears to be slightly longer than the right tail. While we are dealing with sample means now, the conclusions obtained are strikingly similar to those presented in Subsection 7.4.2 when discussing the sampling distribution for the sample proportion. 7.4.4 The sampling distribution of the sample mean As we did in the case of the sample proportion, we are interested in learning key characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, namely: The center of the sampling distribution The effect of sampling variation on the sampling distribution and the effect of the sample size on sampling variation The shape of the sampling distribution 7.4.5 Random variables Once again, we use random variable to formalize our understanding of the sample distribution of the sample mean. Instead of using Bernoulli trials as we did in the case of sample proportions, our trials will record the almond weights. We again modify the bowl activity slightly. In lieu of selecting a sample of almonds all at once, we randomly select one almond at a time, we record the weight of the almond and return it to the bowl before selecting another almond, so the configuration of weights and the chances of any of the almonds to be selected is the same every time we choose one. Getting a sample of 25 almonds is performing these trials 25 times to obtain 25 weights. Then, the average of these 25 numbers is the average weight or mean weight of a sample of 25 almonds. This is what we call a sample mean. Using random variables, we now let uppercase \\(X_1\\) to be the random variable that represents the weight of the first almond before it has been selected, \\(X_2\\) the weight of the second almond, and so on. These are random variables because they can take any possible almond weight value from the bowl. After the first trial is completed, the value of \\(X_1\\) is realized as the weight in grams of the first almond selected. We can represent this value by the lowercase \\(x_1\\) as it is no longer a random variable but a number and we can write \\(X_1 = x_1\\). After the second trial is completed, \\(X_2 = x_2\\), where lowercase \\(x_2\\) is the observe almond weight, and so on. Since our experiment is to perform 25 trials and then find the average of them, this average or mean, before the trials are carried out, can also be expressed as a random variable: \\[\\overline X = \\frac{X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_{25}}{25}.\\] Observe that \\(\\overline X\\) is the average, or mean, of these 25 trials. This is again why \\(\\overline X\\) is called the sample mean. Recall that when dealing with proportions, the trials are Bernoulli trials, represented only with zeros or ones. In this context, sample proportions are a special case of sample means. The trials we use now are not restricted to zeros and ones, and the sample means are no longer sample proportions. For example, let’s focus on the sample of 25 almond weights used earlier and their sample mean: almonds_sample # A tibble: 25 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 4645 3 2 1 3629 3.9 3 1 4796 4 4 1 2669 3.8 5 1 3488 4.3 6 1 105 4.1 7 1 1762 3.6 8 1 1035 4.2 9 1 4880 3.2 10 1 398 4 # ℹ 15 more rows By looking at the weights in the data frame almonds_sample, observe that \\(X_1 = 3.0\\) grams, \\(X_2 = 3.9\\) grams, \\(X_3 = 4.0\\) grams, and so on. If you view the entire data frame, for example running View(almonds_sample) in R, you could check that \\(X_{23} = 3.3\\), \\(X_{24} = 4.4\\), and \\(X_{25} = 3.6\\), so the sample mean would be \\[\\overline X = \\frac{3.0+3.9+4.0+\\dots+3.3+4.4+3.6}{25} = \\frac{91.8}{25}=3.67.\\] In R: almonds_sample |&gt; summarize(sample_mean_weight = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate sample_mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.67 So, once this sample was observed, the random variable \\(\\overline X\\) was realized as \\(\\overline X = 3.67\\), the sample mean was 3.67 grams. Note that the possible values that \\(\\overline X\\) can take are all the possible sample means from samples of 25 almonds from the bowl. The chances of getting these sample means are determined by the configuration of almond weights in the bowl. When \\(\\overline X\\) is constructed as the sample mean of a given random sample, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is precisely the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). In this context, recall what we are interested in determining: The center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) The effect of sampling variation on the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) and the effect of the sample size on sampling variation The shape of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) As we did when dealing with sample proportions, we use simulations again to produce good approximations of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), the sample mean weight of almonds. We also work with samples of size 25, 50, and 100 to learn about changes in sample variation when the sample size changes. This is the process we follow: we generate 1000 samples, obtain the sample means of almond weights, and use them to draw histograms. We do this three times with the size argument set to 25, 50, and 100, respectively. We run each of the following code segments individually and then compare the resulting histograms. # Segment 1: sample size = 25 ------------------------------ # 1.a) Obtaining the 1000 sample means, each from random samples of size 25 virtual_mean_weight_25 &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 25, reps = 1000)|&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), n = n()) # 1.b) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_mean_weight_25, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, boundary = 3.6, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample mean weights for random samples of 25 almonds&quot;, title = &quot;25&quot;) # Segment 2: sample size = 50 ------------------------------ # 2.a) Obtaining the 1000 sample means, each from random samples of size 50 virtual_mean_weight_50 &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000)|&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), n = n()) # 2.b) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_mean_weight_50, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, boundary = 3.6, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample mean weights for random samples of 50 almonds&quot;, title = &quot;50&quot;) # Segment 3: sample size = 100 ------------------------------ # 3.a) Obtaining the 1000 sample means, each from random samples of size 100 virtual_mean_weight_100 &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 100, reps = 1000)|&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), n = n()) # 3.b) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_mean_weight_100, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, boundary = 3.6, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample mean weights for random samples of 100 almonds&quot;, title = &quot;100&quot;) We present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes in Figure 7.24 so the comparison among them is clear. FIGURE 7.24: Comparing histograms of sample means when using different sample sizes. Observe that all three histograms are bell-shaped and appear to center around the same middle value highlighted by the line at the middle. In addition, the magnitude of the sampling variation decreases when the sample size used to obtain the sample mean increases. As it happened with the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, the measures of center and dispersion of these distributions are directly related to the parameters of the population: the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), and the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). We print these parameters one more time here: almonds_bowl |&gt; summarize(mu = mean(weight), sigma = sd(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 mu sigma &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.64 0.392 And we do the same for our simulations next. Recall that the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\) is the value we would expect to observe, on average, when we take many sample means from random samples of a given size. It is located at the center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). Similarly, the standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) is the measure of dispersion or magnitude of sampling variation. It is the standard deviation of the sample means obtained from all possible random samples of a given size. Using the data wrangling code mean() and sd() functions inside summarize() and applied to our simulation values, we can estimate the expected value and standard error of \\(\\overline X\\). Three sets of values are obtained, each for the corresponding sample sizes and presented in Table 7.1. # n = 25 virtual_mean_weight_25 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_25 = mean(mean_weight), sd = sd(mean_weight)) # n = 50 virtual_mean_weight_50 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_50 = mean(mean_weight), sd = sd(mean_weight)) # n = 100 virtual_mean_weight_100 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_100 = mean(mean_weight), sd = sd(mean_weight)) TABLE 7.1: TABLE 7.2: Comparing expected values and standard errors for three different sample sizes Sample size Expected Value Standard Error 25 3.65 0.077 50 3.65 0.053 100 3.65 0.038 In summary: The estimated expected value was either 3.65 or 3.64. This is either near or equal to \\(\\mu = 3.64\\), the population mean weight of almonds in the entire bowl. The standard error decreases when the sample size increases. If we focus on the result obtained for \\(n=100\\), the standard error was 0.038. When compared with the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 0.392\\) this standard error is about one tenth the value of \\(\\sigma\\). Similarly when \\(n=25\\) the standard error 0.077 is about one fifth the value of \\(\\sigma\\) and that pattern also holds when \\(n=50\\). As was the case for the sample proportion, the standard error is inversely proportional to the squared sample size used to construct the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). This is also a theoretical result that can be expressed as: \\[SE_{\\overline X} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt {n}}\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size and \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation. 7.4.6 The Central Limit Theorem revisited Finally, observe that the shapes of the histograms in Figure 7.24 are bell-shaped and seem to approximate the normal distribution. As we did with proportions, in Figures 7.25 and 7.26 we compare our histograms with the theoretical curve for the normal distribution. FIGURE 7.25: The distribution of the sample mean. FIGURE 7.26: The distribution of the sample mean. We conclude that the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), that is, the sampling distribution of the sample mean, when the sample size is large enough, follows approximately a normal distribution with mean equal to the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, \\(\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). We can write this as \\[\\overline X \\sim Normal \\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}\\right)\\] 7.5 The Sampling Distribution in Other Scenarios In Sections 7.1, 7.3, and 7.4, we have provided information about the expected value, the standard error, and the shape of the sampling distribution when the statistic of interest are sample proportions or sample means. It is possible to study the sampling distribution of other statistics. In this section we explore some of them. 7.5.1 Sampling distribution for two samples Assume that we would like to compare the parameters of two populations, for example the means or proportion of those populations. To do this a random sample is taken from the first population and another random sample, independent from the first, is obtained from the second population. Then we can use a statistic from each sample, such as the sample mean or sample proportion, and use them to produce sampling distributions that depend on two independent samples. We provide two examples to illustrate how the sampling distributions are affected. Difference in sample means The problem at hand could be that the chocolate-covered almonds’ weight for almonds in a bowl needs to be compared with the chocolate-covered coffee beans’ weight for coffee beans in a different bowl. The statistic we now consider is the difference in the sample means for samples obtained from these two bowls. As it happens, most of the properties we have presented for a single sample mean or sample proportion can be extended directly to two-sample problems. We now provide the mathematical details for this problem. We assume that for the chocolate-covered almonds’ weight the population mean and standard deviation are given by \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_1\\) and for the chocolate-covered coffee beans’ weight the population mean and standard deviation are given by \\(\\mu_2\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\). Our sampling exercise has now two components. First, we take a random sample of size \\(n_1\\) from the almonds’ bowl and find the sample mean. As we did before, we can let \\(\\overline X_1\\) represent the possible values that the sample mean can take for each possible sample. Second, we let \\(n_2\\) represent the sample size used for samples from the coffee beans’ bowl and the random variable \\(\\overline X_2\\) represent the possible values that the sample mean can take for each possible sample. To compare these two sample means, we obtain the difference, \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). The distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\) is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means. The expected value and standard error of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\) is given by \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) and \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_2}{n_2}},\\] respectively. If the distributions of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are approximately normal due to the CLT, so is the distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). We can write all these properties at once:\\[\\overline X - \\overline Y \\sim Normal \\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_2}{n_2}} \\right)\\] Observe how the standard deviation of the difference is the sum of squared standard deviations from each sample mean. The reason we add standard deviations instead of subtract is because whether you add or subtract statistics, you are effectively adding more uncertainty into your results and the dispersion increases because of it. Difference in sample proportions Comparing two sample proportions can be very useful. We may be interested in comparing the proportion of patients that improve using one treatment versus the proportion of patients that improve using a different treatment, or the proportion of winter accidents on a highway using one type of tire versus another. To illustrate how the sampling distribution works for the difference in sample proportions, we modify the examples used earlier. Assume that we want to compare the proportion of red balls in the first bowl with the proportion of almonds that are heavier than 3.8 grams in the second bowl. This example shows one way to convert numeric data like almond weights into a Boolean result instead. The statistic we now consider is the difference in these sample proportions for samples obtained from these two bowls. The samples obtained from each bowl do not need to be of the same size; for example, we can obtain samples of size \\(n_1 = 50\\) from the first bowl and samples of size \\(n_2 = 60\\) from the second bowl. We proceed by obtaining a random sample from the first bowl, calculating the sample proportion of red balls, getting a random sample from the second bowl, calculating the proportion of almonds heavier than 3.8 grams, and finding the difference in sample proportion of red balls minus the sample proportion of almonds greater than 3.8 grams (the resulting statistic). We can use R to produce the required virtual samples and differences. We then use them to approximate the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions. Our sampling exercise has again two components. First, we take a random sample of \\(n_1 = 50\\) balls from the bowl of red balls and calculate the sample proportion or red balls. As we did before, we let \\(\\overline X_1\\) represent the possible values that the sample proportion can take for each possible sample. Recall that \\(\\overline X_1\\) is the sample proportion in this context, which is also the sample mean of Bernoulli trials. Second, we let \\(n_2 = 60\\) represent the sample size used for samples from the almonds’ bowl and the random variable \\(\\overline X_2\\) represent the possible values that the sample proportion of almonds greater than 3.8 grams can take for each possible sample. To compare these two sample proportions, we obtain the difference, \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). The distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\) is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions. We use virtual sampling to approximate this distribution. We use the rep_slice_sample and summarize functions to produce the random samples and the necessary sample proportions, respectively. A total of 1000 random samples and sample proportions are obtained from each bowl with the appropriate sample sizes, 50 and 60, respectively. Moreover, the inner_join function introduce in Section 3.7 is used here to merge the sample proportions into a single data frame and the difference in these sample proportions is obtained for each replication. n1 &lt;- 50 n2&lt;- 60 virtual_prop_red &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_almond &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 60, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarise(prop_almond = mean(weight &gt; 3.8)) prop_joined &lt;- virtual_prop_red |&gt; inner_join(virtual_prop_almond, by = &quot;replicate&quot;) |&gt; mutate(prop_diff = prop_red - prop_almond) The results are stored in the data frame prop_joined. The variable prop_diff in this data frame represents the difference in sample proportions. We present here the first 10 values of this data frame: prop_joined # A tibble: 1,000 × 4 replicate prop_red prop_almond prop_diff &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 0.45 -0.21 2 2 0.46 0.5 -0.0400 3 3 0.38 0.35 0.0300 4 4 0.36 0.433 -0.0733 5 5 0.38 0.367 0.0133 6 6 0.3 0.317 -0.0167 7 7 0.42 0.383 0.0367 8 8 0.42 0.483 -0.0633 9 9 0.32 0.5 -0.18 10 10 0.48 0.433 0.0467 # ℹ 990 more rows As we did before, we construct a histogram for these 1000 differences. It is shown in Figure 7.27. ggplot(prop_joined, aes(x = prop_diff)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 0, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Difference in sample proportions&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 1000 differences in sample proportions&quot;) FIGURE 7.27: The distribution of 1000 difference in sample proportions based on 1000 random samples of size 50 from the first bowl and 1000 random sample of size 60 from the second bowl. The sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions also looks bell-shaped and it appears to be centered at some negative value somewhere around -0.05. As it happened with a single sample proportion or a sample mean, the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions also follows a normal distribution and the expected difference as well as the standard error rely on information from the population and the sample size. Here are the mathematical details: \\(\\overline X_1\\) is the random variable that represents the sample proportion of red balls of size \\(n_1 = 50\\), \\(\\overline X_2\\) is the random variable that represents the sample proportion of almonds heavier than 3.8 grams, taken from samples of size \\(n_2 = 60\\). The proportion of red balls the population proportion and standard deviation are given by \\(p_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}\\) and for the almonds’ weight the population proportion and standard deviation are given by \\(p_2\\) and \\(\\sigma_2 = \\sqrt{p_2(1-p_2)}\\). The expected value and standard error of the difference, \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\), is given by \\(p_1 - p_2\\) and \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}},\\] respectively. If the distributions of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are approximately normal due to the CLT, so is the distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). We can write all these properties at once: \\[\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2 \\sim Normal \\left(p_1 - p_2, \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \\right)\\] 7.6 Summary and Final Remarks 7.6.1 Summary of scenarios These are not the only cases where the sampling distribution can be obtained. For example, when performing linear regression, we can obtain the sampling distribution for the slope of the regression line and the behavior will be similar to what we have described here. We will discuss inference in the context of linear regression in Chapter 10. For now, we present a summary of the different scenarios presented in this chapter.

In the upcoming Chapter 8 we will delve deeper into the concept of statistical inference, building upon the foundations we have already established this chapter on sampling. This chapter introduces us to the idea of estimating population parameters using sample data, a key aspect of inferential statistics. We will explore how to construct and interpret confidence intervals, particularly focusing on understanding what they imply about population parameters. This involves grasping the concept of a confidence level and recognizing the limitations and proper usage of confidence intervals. The chapter is designed to enhance our practical understanding through examples and applications, enabling us to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. The sd() function actually calculates the sample standard deviation, which divides the sum of squared deviations by \\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\). The difference is noticeable for small numbers of values but almost irrelevant, for practical purposes, when using a large number of values. It is used here for simplicity.↩︎ As explained earlier, this function produces the sample standard deviation, which divides the sum of square deviations by \\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\), but for a list of 5000 observations the difference is not relevant, for practical purposes.↩︎ "],["8-confidence-intervals.html", "Chapter 8 Estimation, Confidence Intervals, and Bootstrapping 8.1 Introduction 8.2 Tying Sampling Distribution to Estimation 8.3 Estimation with the Bootstrap 8.4 Theoretical Framework 8.5 Case study: Is yawning contagious? 8.6 Summary and Final Remarks", " Chapter 8 Estimation, Confidence Intervals, and Bootstrapping 8.1 Introduction We studied sampling in Chapter 7. Recall, for example, getting many random samples of red and white balls from a bowl, obtaining the sample proportions of red balls from each of those samples, and studying the distribution of the sample proportions. We can summarize our findings as follows: the sampling distribution of the sample proportion follows, approximately, the normal distribution, the expected value of the sample proportion, located at the center of the distribution, is exactly equal to the population proportion, and the sampling variation, measured by the standard error of the sample proportion, is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size used to collect the samples. Similarly, when sampling chocolate-covered almonds and getting the sample mean weight from each sample, the characteristics described above are also encountered in the sampling distribution of the sample mean; namely, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows, approximately, the normal distribution; the expected value of the sample mean is the population mean, and the standard error of the sample mean is the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. Moreover, these characteristics also apply to sampling distributions for the difference of sample means, the difference of sample proportions, and others. Recall that the sampling distribution is not restricted by the distribution of the population. As long as the samples taken are fairly large and we use the appropriate standard error, see ??, we can generalize these results appropriately. The study of the sampling distribution is motivated by another question we have not yet answered: how can we determine the average weight of all the almonds if we do not have access to the entire bowl? We have seen by using simulations in Chapter 7 that the average of the sample means, obtained from many random samples, will be fairly close to the expected value of the sample mean, which is precisely the population mean weight. However, in real-life situations, we do not have access to many random samples, only to a single random sample. This chapter introduces methods and techniques that can help us approximate the information of the entire population, such as the population mean weight, by using a single random sample from this population. This undertaking is called estimation, and it is central to Statistics and Data Science. We introduce some statistical jargon about estimation. If we are using a sample statistic to estimate a population parameter, e.g., using the sample mean from a random sample to estimate the population mean, we call this statistic a point estimate to make emphasis that it is a single value that is used to estimate the parameter of interest. Now, you may recall that, due to sampling variation, the sample mean typically does not match the population mean exactly, even if the sample is large. To account for this variation, we use an interval to estimate the parameter instead of a single value, and appropriately call it an interval estimate or, if given some level of accuracy, a confidence interval of the population parameter. In this chapter, we explain how to obtain confidence intervals, the advantages of using them, and the different methods that can be used to obtain them. In Section 8.2 we introduce a method to build a confidence interval for the population mean that uses the random sample obtained and theoretical characteristics of the sampling distribution discussed in Chapter 7. We call this the theory-based approach for constructing intervals. In Section 8.3 we introduce another method, called the bootstrap, that produces confidence intervals by resampling a large number of times from the original sample. Since resampling is done via simulations, we call this the simulation-based approach for constructing confidence intervals. In Section @ref(theory_CI) we provide some theoretical foundations to explain the logic behind the bootstrap, introduce some alternatives within this approach, compare it with the theory-based approach, and show the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Finally, in Section 8.6 we summarize and present extensions of these methods. Needed packages If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(infer) Recall that loading the tidyverse package loads many packages that we have encountered earlier. For details refer to Section 4.4. The packages moderndive and infer contain functions and data frames that will be used in this chapter. 8.2 Tying Sampling Distribution to Estimation In this section we revisit the chocolate-covered almonds example introduced in Chapter 7 and the results obtained when studying the sampling distribution of the sample mean weight of almonds, but this time we use this information in the context of estimation. We start by introducing or reviewing some terminology using the almonds’ example. The bowl of chocolate-covered almonds is the population of interest. The parameter of interest is the population mean weight of almonds in the bowl, \\(\\mu\\). This is the quantity we want to estimate. We want to use the sample mean to estimate this parameter. So we call the sample mean an estimator or an estimate of \\(\\mu\\), the population mean weight. The difference between estimator and estimate is worth discussing. As an illustration, we decide to take a random sample of 100 almonds from the bowl and use its sample mean weight to estimate the population mean weight. In other words, we intend to sum 100 almonds’ weights, divide this sum by 100, and use this value to estimate the population mean weight. When we refer to the sample mean to describe this process via an equation, the sample mean weight is called an estimator of the population mean weight. Since different samples produce different sample means, the sample mean as an estimator is the random variable \\(\\overline X\\) described in Section 7.4.5. As we have learned studying the sampling distribution in Chapter 7, we know that this estimator follows, approximately, a normal distribution; its expected value is equal to the population mean weight. Its standard deviation, also called standard error, is \\[SE_{\\bar x} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt {n}}\\] where \\(n = 100\\) in this example and \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation of almonds’ weights. On the other hand, we go ahead and obtain a random sample of 100 almonds’ weights such as the one shown here and store it in the moderndive package with the same name almonds_sample_100 &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1) almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 166 4.2 2 1 1215 4.2 3 1 1899 3.9 4 1 1912 3.8 5 1 4637 3.3 6 1 511 3.5 7 1 127 4 8 1 4419 3.5 9 1 4729 4.2 10 1 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows We can use it to calculate the sample mean weight: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate sample_mean &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 Then \\(\\overline{x} = 3.682\\) grams is an estimate of the population mean weight. In summary, the estimator is the procedure, equation, or method that will be used on a sample to estimate a parameter before the sample has been obtained and has many useful properties discussed in Chapter 7. The moment a sample is obtained and the equation of a sample mean is applied to this sample, the resulting number is an estimate. The sample mean, as an estimator or estimate of the population mean, will be a central component of the material developed in this chapter. But, note that it is not the only quantity of interest. For example, the population standard deviation of the almonds’ weight, denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\sigma\\), is a parameter and the sample standard deviation can be an estimator or estimate of this parameter. Furthermore, we have shown in Chapter 7 that the expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean. When this happens, we call the sample mean an unbiased estimator of the population mean. This does not mean that any sample mean will be equal to the sample mean; some sample means will be greater while others will be smaller but, on average, they will be equal to the population mean. In general, when the expected value of an estimator is equal to the parameter it is trying to estimate, we call the estimator unbiased. If it is not, the estimator is biased. We now revisit the almond activity and study how the sampling distribution of the sample mean can help us build interval estimates for the population mean. 8.2.1 Revisiting the Almond Activity for Estimation In Chapter 7 one of the activities was to take many random samples of size 100 from a bowl of 5,000 chocolate-covered almonds. Since we have access to the contents of the entire bowl, we can obtain the population parameters: almonds_bowl |&gt; summarize(population_mean = mean(weight), population_sd = pop_sd(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 population_mean population_sd &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.64496 0.392070 The total number of almonds in the bowl is 5,000. The population mean is \\[\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000}\\frac{x_i}{5000}=3.54\\] and the population standard deviation defined in the moderndive package as pop_sd() is \\[\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{5000}=0.32.\\] We keep those numbers for future reference to determine how well our methods of estimation are doing, but recall that in real-life situations we do not have access to the population values and the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is unknown. All we have is the information from one random sample. In our example, we assume that all we know is the almonds_sample_100 object stored in package moderndive. We show the contents of the first few rows here: almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 166 4.2 2 1 1215 4.2 3 1 1899 3.9 4 1 1912 3.8 5 1 4637 3.3 6 1 511 3.5 7 1 127 4 8 1 4419 3.5 9 1 4729 4.2 10 1 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows The ID variable shows the almond chosen from the bowl and its corresponding weight. Using this sample we obtain some sample statistics: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), sd_weight = sd(weight), sample_size = n()) # A tibble: 1 × 4 replicate mean_weight sd_weight sample_size &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 3.682 0.362199 100 In one of the activities performed in Chapter 7 we obtained many random samples, calculated their sample means, constructed a histogram using these sample means, and showed how the histogram is a good approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. We redraw Figure 7.26 here as Figure 8.1. FIGURE 8.1: The distribution of the sample mean. The histogram obtained in Figure 8.1 is drawn using many sample mean weights from random samples of size \\(n=100\\). The added red smooth curve is the density curve for the normal distribution with the appropriate expected value and standard error obtained from the sample distribution. The red dot represents the population mean \\(\\mu\\), the unknown parameter we are trying to estimate. The blue dot is the sample mean \\(\\overline{x} = 3.682\\) from the random sample stored in almonds_sample_100. In real-life applications, a sample mean is obtained from a sample but the distribution of the population and the population mean are unknown, so the location of the blue dot with respect to the red dot is also unknown. However, if we construct an interval centered on the blue dot, as long as it is wide enough the interval will contain the red dot. To understand this better, we need to learn a few additional properties of the normal distribution. 8.2.2 The Normal Distribution A random variable can take on different values. When those values can be represented by one or more intervals, the likelihood of those values can be expressed graphically by a density curve on a Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions. The horizontal axis (X-axis) represents the values that the random variable can take and the height of density curve (Y-axis) provides a graphical representation of the likelihood of those values; the higher the curve the more likely those values are. In addition, the total area under a density curve is always equal to 1. The set of values a random variable can take alongside their likelihood is what we call the distribution of a random variable. The normal distribution is the distribution of a special type of random variable. Its density curve has a distinctive bell shape, and it is fully defined by two values: (1) the mean or expected value of the random variable, \\(\\mu\\), which is located on the X-axis at the center of the density curve (its highest point), and (2) the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), which reflects the dispersion of the random variable; the greater the standard deviation is the wider the curve appears. In Figure 8.2, we plot the density curves of three random variables, all following normal distributions: The solid line represents a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) &amp; \\(\\sigma = 2\\). The dotted line represents a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) &amp; \\(\\sigma = 5\\). The dashed line represents a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 15\\) &amp; \\(\\sigma = 2\\). FIGURE 8.2: Three normal distributions. A random variable that follows a normal distribution can take any values in the real line, but those values (on the X-axis) that correspond to the peak of the density curve are more likely than those corresponding to the tails. The density curve drawn with a solid line has the same mean as the one drawn with a dotted line, \\(\\mu = 5\\), but the former exhibits less dispersion, measured by the standard deviation \\(\\sigma =2\\), than the latter, \\(\\sigma = 5\\). Since the total area under any density curve is equal to 1, the wider curve has to be shorter in height to preserve this property. On the other hand, the density curve drawn with a solid line has the same standard deviation as the one drawn with a dashed line, \\(\\sigma = 2\\), but the latter has a greater mean, \\(\\mu = 15\\), than the former, \\(\\mu = 5\\), so they do look the same but the latter is centered farther to the right on the X-axis than the former. 8.2.2.1 The standard normal distribution A special normal distribution is one with mean \\(\\mu\\) = 0 and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) = 1. It is called the standard normal distribution and it is represented by a density curve called the \\(z\\)-curve. If a random variable \\(Z\\) follows the standard normal distribution, a realization of this random variable is called a standard value or \\(z\\)-value. The \\(z\\)-value also represents the number of standard deviations above the mean, if positive, or below the mean, if negative. For example, if \\(z=5\\), the value observed represents a realization of the random variable \\(Z\\) that is five standard deviation above the mean, \\(\\mu = 0\\). 8.2.2.2 Linear transformations of random variables that follow the normal distribution A linear transformation of a random variable transforms the original variable into a new random variable by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing constants to the original values. The resulting random variable could have a different mean and standard deviation. The most interesting transformation is turning a random variable into another with \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1\\). When this happens we say that the random variable has been standardized. A property of the normal distribution is that any linear transformation of a random variable that follows the normal distribution results in a new random variable that also follows a normal distribution, potentially with different mean and standard deviation. In particular, we can turn any random variable that follows the normal distribution into a random variable that follows the standard normal distribution. For example, if a value \\(x = 11\\) comes from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu =5\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 2\\), the \\(z\\)-value \\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{11 - 5}{2} = 3\\] is the corresponding value in a standard normal curve. Moreover, we have determined that \\(x = 11\\) for this example is precisely \\(3\\) standard deviations above the mean. 8.2.2.3 Finding probabilies under a density curve When a random variable can be represented by a density curve, the probability that the random variable takes a value in any given interval (on the X-axis) is equal to the area under the density curve for that interval. If we know the equation that represents the density curve, we could use the mathematical technique from calculas known as integration to determine this area. In the case of the normal curve, the integral for any interval does not have a close form solution and the solution is obtained using numerical approximations. Please review the Section A.2 in the Appendices where we provide R code to work with different areas, probabilities, and values under a normal density curve. Here, we place focus on the insights of specific values and areas without dedicating time to those calculations. We assume that a random variable \\(Z\\) follows a standard normal distribution. We would like to know how likely is for this random variable to take a value that is within one standard deviation from the mean or, equivalently, what is the probability that the observe value \\(z\\) (in the X-axis) is between -1 and 1 as shown in Figure @ref(fig: normal-curve-shaded-1a) Calculations show that this area is 0.6827 or about 68.27% of the total area under the curve. This is equivalent to say that the probability of getting a value between \\(-1\\) and 1 on a standard normal is 68.27%. This also means that if a random variable representing an experiment follows a normal distribution, the probability that the outcome of this experiment is within one standard deviation from the mean is 68.27%. Similarly, the area under the standard normal density curve between -2 and 2 is shown in Figure @ref(fig: normal-curve-shaded-2a). Calculations show that this area is equal to 0.9545 or 95.45%. If a random variable representing an experiment follows a normal distribution, the probability that the outcome of this experiment is within two standard deviations from the mean is 95.45%. It is also common practice to use the exact number of standard deviations that correspond to an area around the mean exactly equal to 95% (instead of 95.45%). Please see the Section A.2 in the Appendices to produce those or other calculations in R. The result is that the area under the density curve around the mean that is exactly equal to 0.95, or 95%, is the area within 1.96 standard deviation from the mean. Remember this number as it will be used a few times in future sections. In summary, if the possible outcomes of an experiment can be expressed as a random variable that follows the normal distribution, the probability of getting a result that is within one standard deviation from the mean is about 68.27%, within 2 standard deviations form the mean is 95.45%, within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean is 95%, and within 3 standard deviations from the mean is about 99.73%, to name a few. Spend a few moments grasping this idea; observe, for example, that it is almost impossible to observe an outcome represented by a number that is around five standard deviations above the mean as the chances of that to happen are almost zero. We are now ready to return to the our main goal: how to obtain an interval estimate of the population mean based on a single sample. 8.2.3 The confidence interval We continue using the example where we try to estimate the population mean weight of almonds with a random sample of 100 almonds. We showed in Chapter 7 that the sampling distribution of the sample mean weight of almonds approximates a normal distribution with expected value equal to the population mean weight of almonds and a standard error equal to \\[SE_{\\bar x} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt {100}}.\\] In Subsection 8.2.1 we showed that for the population of almonds, \\(\\mu =3.54\\) grams and \\(\\sigma = 0.323\\) so the standard error for the sampling distribution is \\[SE_{\\bar x} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt {100}} = \\frac{0.323}{\\sqrt{100}} = 0.0323\\] grams. In Figure 8.3 we plot the density curve for this distribution using these values. FIGURE 8.3: The normal density curve for the sample mean weight of almonds. The horizontal axis (X-axis) represents the sample means that we can obtain from all the possible random samples of 100 almonds. The red dot represents the expected value of the sampling distribution, \\(\\mu = 3.54\\), located on the X-axis at the center of the distribution. The density curve’s height can be thought of as how likely those sample means are to be observed. For example, it is more likely to get a random sample with a sample mean around \\(3.54\\) grams (which corresponds to the highest point of the curve) than it is to get a sample with a sample mean at around \\(3.4\\) grams, since the curve’s height is almost zero at that value. The blue dot is the sample mean from our sample of 100 almonds, \\(\\overline{x} = 3.682\\) grams. It is located 0.142 grams above the population mean weight. How far is 0.04 grams? It is helpful to express this distance in standardized values: \\[\\frac{3.58 - 3.54}{0.0323} = 1.24\\] so 0.04 more grams is about 1.24 standard errors above the population mean. In real-life situations, the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), is unknown so the distance from the sample mean to \\(\\mu\\) is also unknown. On the other hand, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows a normal distribution. Based on our earlier discussion about areas under the normal curve, there is a 95% chance that the value observed is within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean. In the context of our problem, there is a 95% chance that the sample mean weight obtained is within 1.96 standard errors from the population mean weight. As shown earlier, the sample mean obtained in our example was 1.24 standard errors above the population mean, well within the reasonable range. Think about this result. If we were to take a different random sample of 100 almonds, the sample mean will likely be different, but you still have a 95% chance that the new sample mean will be within 1.96 standard errors from the population mean. We can finally construct an interval estimate that takes advantage of this configuration. We center our interval in the sample mean observed and then extend to each side the magnitude equivalent to 1.96 standard errors. The lower and upper bounds of this interval are: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) &amp;= \\left(3.578 - 1.96 \\cdot \\frac{0.323}{\\sqrt{100}},\\quad 3.578 + 1.96 \\cdot \\frac{0.323}{\\sqrt{100}}\\right)\\\\ &amp;= (3.515, 3.641)\\end{aligned}\\] Here is R code that can be used to calculate the lower and upper bounds of this interval almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), lower_bound = mean(weight) - 1.96*0.323/sqrt(length(weight)), upper_bound = mean(weight) + 1.96*0.323/sqrt(length(weight))) # A tibble: 1 × 4 replicate sample_mean lower_bound upper_bound &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 3.61869 3.74531 The functions mean() and length() find the sample mean weight and sample size, respectively, from the sample of almonds’ weights in almonds_sample_100. The number 1.96 corresponds to the number of standard errors needed to obtain a 95% area under the normal distribution and the population standard deviation 0.323 was found in Subsection 8.2.1. Figure @ref(fig: normal-curve-2) shows this interval as a horizontal blue line. Observe how the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is part of this interval. [1] 3.51 3.64 FIGURE 8.4: The normal density curve for the sample mean weight of almonds. Since 1.96 standard errors were used on the construction of this interval, we call this a 95% confidence interval. A confidence interval can be viewed as an interval estimator of the population mean. Compare an interval estimator with the sample mean that is a point estimator. The latter estimates the parameter with a single number, the former provides and entire interval to account for the location of the parameter. An apt analogy involves fishing. Imagine that there is a single fish swimming in murky water. The fish is not visible but its movement produces ripples on the surface that can provide some limited information about the fish’s location. To capture the fish, one could use a spear or a net. Because the information is limited, throwing the spear at the ripples may capture the fish but likely miss it. Throwing a net around the ripples, on the other hand, may give a much higher likelihood of capturing the fish. Using the sample mean only to estimate the population mean is like throwing a spear to the ripples in the hopes of capturing the fish. Constructing a confidence interval that may include the population mean is like throwing a net to surround the ripples. Keep this analogy in mind, as we will revisit it in future sections. 8.2.4 The t distribution Recall that due to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean was approximately normal with mean equal to the population mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation given by the standard error \\(SE_{\\overline X} = \\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). We can standardize this for any sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) such that \\[z = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\] is the corresponding value of the standard normal distribution. In the construction of the interval in Figure @ref(fig: normal-curve-2) we have assumed the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), was known, and therefore we have use it to obtain the confidence interval. Nevertheless, in real-life applications, the population standard deviation is also unknown. Instead, we use the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), from the sample we have obtained, as an estimator of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Our estimated standard error is given by \\[\\widehat{SE}_{\\overline X} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt n}.\\] When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the standard error, we are introducing additional uncertainty in our model. For example, if we try to standardize this value we get \\[t = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\\]. Because we are using the sample standard deviation in this equation and since the sample standard deviation changes from sample to sample, the additional uncertainty makes the values \\(t\\) no longer normal. Instead they follow a new distribution called the \\(t\\) distribution. The \\(t\\) distribution is similar to the standard normal; its density curve is also bell-shaped and it is symmetric around zero, but the tails of the \\(t\\) distribution are a little thicker than those of the standard normal. In addition, the \\(t\\) distribution requires one additional parameter, the degrees of freedom. For the sample mean problems, the degrees of freedom needed are exactly \\(n-1\\), the size of the sample minus one. Figure @ref(fig: t-curve-1) shows the density curves of the standard normal density curve, in black, a \\(t\\) density curve for a t distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, in blue, and a \\(t\\) density curve for a t distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, in red. FIGURE 8.5: The normal density curve for the sample mean weight of almonds. Observe how the \\(t\\) density curve in red (t with 10 degrees of freedom) gets closer to the standard normal density curve, or \\(z\\)-curve, in black, than the \\(t\\) curve in blue (t with 2 degrees of freedom). The greater the number of degrees of freedom, the closer the \\(t\\) density curve is from the \\(z\\) curve. This change make our calculations slightly different. Please see Appendix ?? for calculations of probabilities for \\(t\\) density curves with different degrees of freedom. The calculation for our specific example show that 95% of the sample means are within 1.98 standard errors of the population mean weight. The number of standard errors needed is not that different from before, 1.98 versus 1.96, because the degrees of freedom are fairly large. Using this information, we can construct the 95% confidence interval based entirely on our sample information and using the sample mean and sample standard deviation. We calculate those values again for almonds_sample_100: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), sample_sd = sd(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 3 replicate sample_mean sample_sd &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 0.362199 Observe that the sample standard deviation is \\(s = 0.3218\\) which is not that different form the population standard deviation. We again center the confidence interval in the observed sample mean but now extend the interval by 1.98 standard errors to each side. The lower and upper bounds of this confidence interval are: \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = \\left(3.578 - 1.98 \\cdot \\frac{0.3218}{\\sqrt{100}}, 3.578 + 1.98 \\cdot \\frac{0.3218}{\\sqrt{100}}\\right)= (3.514, 3.642)\\] Here is the R code that can be used to found the lower and upper bounds on this interval almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), sample_sd = sd(weight), lower_bound = mean(weight) - 1.98*sd(weight)/sqrt(length(weight)), upper_bound = mean(weight) + 1.98*sd(weight)/sqrt(length(weight))) # A tibble: 1 × 5 replicate sample_mean sample_sd lower_bound upper_bound &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 0.362199 3.61028 3.75372 The confidence interval obtained here, using the sample standard deviation and a \\(t\\) distribution, is almost the same to the one obtained using the population standard deviation and the standard normal distribution, the difference is about 0.001 units for the upper and lower bound. This happens because with a sample size of 100, the t-curve and z-curve are almost identical and also because the sample standard deviation was very similar to the population standard deviation. This does not have to be always the case and occasionally we can observe greater differences; but, in general, the results are fairly similar. More importantly, the confidence interval constructed here contains the population mean, which is the result we needed. Recall that a confidence interval is an interval estimate of the parameter of interest, the population mean weight of almonds. We can summarize the results so far: If the size used for your random sample is large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows, approximately, the normal distribution. Using the sample mean observed and the standard error of the sampling distribution, we can construct 95% confidence intervals for the population mean. The formula for these intervals is given by \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size used. When the population standard deviation is unknown, the sample standard deviation is used to estimate the standard error. This produces additional variability and the standardized values follow a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. The formula for 95% confidence intervals when the sample size is \\(n=100\\) is given by \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{100}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{100}}\\right)\\] The method to construct 95% confidence intervals guarantees that for 95% of the possible samples, the intervals obtained will include the population mean. It also guarantees that 5% of the possible samples will lead to intervals that do not include the population mean. As we have constructed intervals with a 95% level of confidence, we can construct intervals with any level of confidence. The only change in the equations will be the number of standard errors needed. Please see Appendix ?? if you need to calculate the number of standard errors for other confidence levels. 8.2.5 Interpreting Confidence Intervals We have used the sample almonds_sample_100, constructed a 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of almonds, and showed that the interval contained this population. This result is not surprising as we expect intervals such as this to include the population mean for 95% of the possible random samples. We repeat this interval construction for many random samples. Figure ?? presents the results for eighty 95% confidence intervals. FIGURE 8.6: (ref:almond-mean-ci) Note that each interval was build using a different random sample. The red vertical line is drawn at the location of the population mean weight, \\(\\mu = 3.54\\). The horizontal lines represent the eighty 95% confidence intervals obtained. The gray confidence intervals cross the red line so they contain the population mean. The black confidence intervals do not. This result motivates the meaning of a 95% confidence interval: If you could construct intervals using the procedure described earlier for every possible random sample, then 95% of these intervals will include the population mean and 5% of them will not. Of course, in most situations it would impractical or impossible to obtain every possible random sample. Still, for a large number of random samples, this results is approximately correct. In Figure 8.6, for example, 5 out of 80 confidence intervals, or 6.25%, do not include the population mean, and 93.75% do. The term 95% confidence invites to think we are talking about probabilities or chances. Indeed we are, but in a subtle way. Before a random sample has been obtained, there is a 95% chance that when a confidence interval is constructed using the prospective random sample, this interval will contain the population mean. The moment a random sample has been obtained, the interval constructed either contains the population mean or does not, with certainty, there is no longer a chance involved. This is true even if we do not know what the population mean is. So the 95% confidence refers to the method or process to be used on a prospective sample. We are confident that if we follow the process to construct the interval, 95% of the time the random sample obtained will lead us to produce an interval that contains the population mean. On the other hand, it would be improper to say that… “there is a 95% chance that the confidence interval obtained contains the population mean.” Looking at Figure 8.6, each of the confidence intervals either does or does not contain \\(\\mu\\). Once the confidence interval is determined, either the population mean is included or not. In the literature, this explanation has been encapsulated in a short-hand version: we are 95% confident that the interval contains the population parameter. For example, in Subsection 8.2.4 the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of almonds was (3.516, 3.644) and we would say: “We are 95% confident that the population mean weight of almonds is between 3.516 and 3.644 grams”. It is perfectly acceptable to use the short-hand statement, but always remember that the 95% confidence refers to the process, or method, and can be thought of as a chance or probability only before the random sample has been obtained. 8.2.5.1 Understanding the width of a confidence interval A confidence interval is an estimator of a population parameter. In the case of the almonds’ bowl we constructed a confidence interval for the population mean. The equation to construct a 95% confidence interval was \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\] Observe that the confidence interval is centered at the sample mean and it extends to each side 1.96 standard errors \\[1.96\\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] This quantity is exactly half the width of your confidence interval and it is called margin of error. The value of the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), is beyond our control, as it is determined by the distribution of the experiment or phenomenon studied and the sample mean, \\(\\overline{x}\\), is a result that depends on your random sample exclusively. On the other hand, the number 1.96 or the sample size, \\(n\\), are value that can be changed by the researcher or practitioner and they play an important role on the width of the confidence interval. We study each of them separately. The confidence level We mentioned earlier that the number 1.96 relates to a 95% confidence process but we did not show how to obtain this value. The level of confidence is a decision of the practitioner. If you want to be more confident, say 98% or 99% confident, you just need to adjust the appropriate number of standard errors needed. We show how to determine this number and use Figure ?? to illustrate this process. You can find more details in Appendix ?? If the confidence level is 0.95 (or 95%), the area in the middle of the standard normal distribution is 0.95. This area is shaded in the Figure ??. We construct \\(\\alpha = 1 - \\text{confidence level} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\\). Think of \\(\\alpha\\) as the total area on both tails. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the area on each tail is \\(\\alpha/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025\\) We need the exact number of standard deviations that produces the shaded area. Since the center of a standard normal density curve is zero, as shown in Figure ??, and the normal curve is symmetric, the number of standard deviations can be represented by \\(-q\\) and \\(q\\), the same magnitude but one positive and the other negative. In R, the function qnorm() finds the value of \\(q\\) when the area under this curve to the left of this value \\(q\\) is given. In our example the area to the left of \\(-q\\) is \\(\\alpha/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025\\), so qnorm(0.025) [1] -1.96 or 1.96 standard deviation below the mean. Similarly, the total area under the curve to the left of \\(q\\) is the total shaded area, 0.95, plus the the small white area on the left tail, \\(0.025\\), and \\(0.95 + 0.025 = 0.975\\), so qnorm(0.975) [1] 1.96 That is the reason we use 1.96 standard deviation when calculating 95% confidence intervals. What if we want to obtain a 98% confidence interval? We follow the same procedure: The confidence level is 0.98, \\(\\alpha = 1 - \\text{confidence level} = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02\\). . The area on each tail is \\(\\alpha/2 = 0.02/2 = 0.01\\) The area needed to obtain \\(q\\) is 0.98+0.01 = 0.99 qnorm(0.99) [1] 2.33 If we want to obtain a 98% confidence interval, we need to use 2.33 standard errors in our calculations. We can update the R code to calculate the lower and upper bounds of a 98% confidence interval: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), lower_bound = mean(weight) - qnorm(0.99)*0.323/sqrt(length(weight)), upper_bound = mean(weight) + qnorm(0.99)*0.323/sqrt(length(weight))) # A tibble: 1 × 4 replicate sample_mean lower_bound upper_bound &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 3.60686 3.75714 Let us do one more. If we want an 80% confidence interval, 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, 0.2/2 = 0.1, and 0.8+0.1 = 0.9, so qnorm(0.9) [1] 1.28 When you want to obtain an 80%, 95%, or 98% confidence intervals, you need to construct your interval using 1.28, 1.96, or 2.33 standard errors, respectively. The more confident you want to be, the larger number of standard errors you need to use, and the wider your confidence interval becomes. But a confidence interval is an estimator of the population mean, the narrower it is, the more useful for practical reasons. So there is a trade off between the width of a confidence interval and the confidence you want to have. The sample size As we studied changes to the confidence level, the researcher can determine how big is the random sample to be used. The margin of error for a 955 confidence interval is \\[1.96\\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\] If the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases proportional to the square root of the sample size. For example, if we obtain a random sample of size 25, \\(1/sqrt(25) = 0.2\\), and if we obtain a sample of size 100, \\(1/sqrt(100) = 0.1\\). By choosing a larger sample size, four times larger, we produce a confidence interval that is half the width. This result is worth considering. A confidence interval is an estimator of the parameter of interest, such as the population mean weight of almonds. Ideally we would like to build a confidence interval with a high level of confidence, for example 95% confidence, but we also want an interval that is narrow enough to provide useful information. For example, assume we get the following 95% confidence intervals for the population mean weight of almonds, between 2 and 4 grams, or between 3.51 and 3.64 grams, or between 3.539 and 3.545. The first interval does not seem useful at all, the second works better, and the third is tremendously accurate, as we are 95% confident that the population mean is within 0.006 grams. Obviously, we alway prefer narrower intervals, but there are trade offs we need to consider. We always prefer high levels of confidence, but the more confident we want to be the wider the interval will be. In addition, the larger the random sample used, the narrower the confidence interval will be. Obtaining a large sample is always a preferred choice, but the trade off are external, collecting large samples could be expensive and time consuming. The construction of confidence intervals need to take into account all these considerations. We have concluded the theory-based approach to construct confidence intervals. In the next section we explore a completely different approach to construct confidence intervals and in later sections we will make comparison of these methods. 8.3 Estimation with the Bootstrap In 1979 Brad Efron published an article introducing a method called the bootstrap. The idea is the following: a random sample of size \\(n\\) is obtained from the population. This sample is used to obtain another sample, with replacement, also of size \\(n\\). This is called resampling with replacement and the resulting sample is called a bootstrap sample. For example, if the original sample is \\[\\{4,2,5,4,1,3,7,4,6,1\\},\\] a bootstrap sample could be \\[\\{6, 4, 7, 4, 2, 7, 2, 5, 4, 1\\}.\\] Observe that the number 7 appears once in the original sample, but twice in the bootstrap sample; similarly, the number 3 in the original sample does not appear in the bootstrap sample. This is not uncommon for a bootstrap sample, some of the numbers in the original sample are repeated and others are not included. The basic idea of the bootstrap is to obtain a large number of bootstrap samples, all drawn from the same original sample. Then, we use all these bootstrap samples to obtain estimates of population parameters, standard errors, or even the density curve of the population. Using them we can construct confidence intervals, perform hypothesis testing, and other inferential methods. This method takes advantage of the large number of bootstrap samples that can be obtained. In several respects, this exercise is not different from the sampling distribution explained in Chapter 7. The only difference, albeit an important one, is that we are not sampling from the population, we are sampling from the original sample. How many different bootstrap samples could we get from a single sample? A very large number, actually. If the original sample has 10 numbers, as the one shown above, each possible bootstrap sample of size 10 is obtained by sampling 10 times with replacement, so the total number of bootstrap samples is \\(10^{10}\\) or 10 billion different bootstrap samples. If the original sample has 20 numbers, the number of bootstrap samples is \\(20^{20}\\), a number greater than the total number of stars in the universe. Even with modern powerful computers, it would be an onerous task to obtain every possible bootstrap sample. Instead, a few thousand bootstrap samples are obtained, similar to the simulations performed in Chapter 7, in this number is large enough to provide useful results. Since Efron proposed the bootstrap, the statistical community embraced this method. During the 1980s and 1990s, many theoretical and empirical results were presented showing the strength of bootstrap methods. As an illustration, Efron (1979), Hall (1986), Efron and Tibshirani (1986), and Hall (1988) showed that bootstrapping, was at least as good if not better than existent methods, when the goal was to estimate the standard error of an estimator or find the confidence intervals of a parameter. Modifications were proposed to improve the algorithm in situations where the basic method was not producing accurate results. With the continuous improvement of computing power and speed, and the advantages of having ready to use statistical software for its implementation, the use of the bootstrap is more and more popular in many fields. As an illustration, if we are interested in the mean of the population, \\(\\mu\\), and we have collected one random sample, we can obtain a large number of bootstrap samples from this original sample, use them to obtain sample means, order the sample means from smallest to largest and choose the interval that contains the middle 95% of these sample means. This will be the simplest way to obtain a confidence interval based on the bootstrap. In the next sections we explore how to incorporate this and similar methods to construct confidence intervals. 8.3.1 Bootstrap samples: Revisiting the Almond Activity To study and understand the behavior of bootstrap samples, we return to our example of the chocolate covered almonds in a bowl. Recall that the bowl is considered the population of almonds and we are interested in estimating the population mean weight of almonds. As we did before, we only have access to a single random sample. In this section, we use the data frame almonds_sample_100, a random sample of 100 almonds obtained earlier. We call this the original sample and it is used in this section to create the bootstrap samples. The first 10 rows are shown below: almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 166 4.2 2 1 1215 4.2 3 1 1899 3.9 4 1 1912 3.8 5 1 4637 3.3 6 1 511 3.5 7 1 127 4 8 1 4419 3.5 9 1 4729 4.2 10 1 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows 8.3.1.1 Constructing a bootstrap sample: Resampling once We start by constructing one bootstrap sample of 100 almonds from the original sample of 100 almonds. These are the steps needed to perform this task manually: Step 1: Place the original sample of 100 almonds into a bag or hat. Step 2: Mix the bag contents, draw one almond, weigh it, and record the weight as seen in Figure ??. FIGURE 8.7: Step 3: Drawing one slip of paper at random. Step 3: Put the almond back into the bag! In other words, replace it as seen in Figure 8.8. FIGURE 8.8: Step 4: Replacing slip of paper. Step 5: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 a total of 99 more times, resulting in 100 weights. These steps describe resampling with replacement and the resulting sample is called a bootstrap sample. This procedure results in some almonds to be chosen more than once others almonds not to be chosen at all. Resampling with replacement induces sampling variation so every bootstrap sample can be different than any other. This activity can be performed manually following the steps described above. We can also take advantage of the R code we have introduced in Chapter 7 and do this virtually. The data frame almonds_sample_100 contains the random sample of almonds obtained from the population. We show selected rows from this sample. almonds_sample_100 &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; select(-replicate) almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 2 ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 166 4.2 2 1215 4.2 3 1899 3.9 4 1912 3.8 5 4637 3.3 6 511 3.5 7 127 4 8 4419 3.5 9 4729 4.2 10 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows We use ungroup() and select to eliminate the variable replicate from the almonds_sample_100 as this variable may create clutter when resampling. We can now create a bootstrap sample also of size 100 by resampling with replacement once. boot_sample &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1) We have used this type of R syntax many times in Chapter 7. We first select the data frame almonds_sample_100 that contains the almonds’ weights in the original sample. We then perform resampling with replacement once: we resample by using rep_sample_n(), a sample of size ralmonds_sample_100by settingsize = 100, with replacement by adding the argumentreplace = TRUE, and one time by settingreps = 1. The objectboot_sampleis a bootstrap sample of 100 almonds' weights obtained from the original sample of 100 almonds' weights. We show the first ten rows ofboot_sample` boot_sample # A tibble: 100 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 1459 3.6 2 1 2972 3.4 3 1 1215 4.2 4 1 1381 3.4 5 1 1264 3.5 6 1 199 3.4 7 1 476 3.8 8 1 4806 3.7 9 1 3169 4.1 10 1 2265 3.4 # ℹ 90 more rows We can also study some of the characteristics of this bootstrap sample, such as its sample mean: boot_sample |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 By using summarize() and mean() on the bootrstrap sample boot_sample we determine that the mean weight is 3.68 grams. Recall that the sample mean of the original sample was obtained in the previous Section; it was 3.68. So, the sample mean of the bootstrap sample is different than the sample mean of the original sample. This variation is induced by resampling with replacement, the method used to obtain the bootstrap sample. We can also compare the histogram of weights for the bootstrap sample with the histogram of weights for the original sample. ggplot(boot_sample, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Resample of 100 weights&quot;) ggplot(almonds_sample_100, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Original sample of 100 weights&quot;) FIGURE 8.9: Comparing weight in the resampled boot_sample with the original sample almonds_sample_100. Observe in Figure 8.9 that while the general shapes of both distributions of weights are roughly similar, they are not identical. This is the typical behavior of bootstrap samples. They are samples that have been obtained from the original sample, but because replacement is used before each new observation is obtained, some values appear more than once while others do not appear at all. 8.3.1.2 Many bootstrap samples: Resampling multiple In this Subsection we take full advantage of resampling with replacement by obtaining many bootstrap samples and study relevant information obtained, such as the variability of their sample means. We can start by using the R syntax we used before, this time for 35 replications. bootstrap_samples_35 &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 35) bootstrap_samples_35 # A tibble: 3,500 × 3 # Groups: replicate [35] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 1459 3.6 2 1 2972 3.4 3 1 1215 4.2 4 1 1381 3.4 5 1 1264 3.5 6 1 199 3.4 7 1 476 3.8 8 1 4806 3.7 9 1 3169 4.1 10 1 2265 3.4 # ℹ 3,490 more rows The syntax is the same as before, but this time we set reps= 35 to get 35 bootstrap samples. The resulting data frame, bootstrap_samples, has 35 \\(\\cdot\\) 100 = 3500 rows corresponding to 35 resamples of 100 almonds’ weights. Let’s now compute the resulting 35 sample means using the same dplyr code as we did in the previous section: boot_means &lt;- bootstrap_samples_35 |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) boot_means # A tibble: 35 × 2 replicate mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 25 more rows Observe that boot_means has 35 rows, corresponding to the 35 bootstrap sample means. Furthermore, observe that the values of mean_weight vary. The variation is shown graphically on a histogram in Figure 8.10. ggplot(boot_means, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;sample mean weight in grams&quot;) FIGURE 8.10: Distribution of 35 sample means from 35 bootrap samples This histogram highlights the variation of the sample mean weights. Since we have only used 35 bootstrap samples, the histogram looks a little coarse. To improve our perception of this variation, we obtain 1000 bootstrap samples and their sample means: # Obtain 1000 bootstrap samples bootstrap_samples &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) # Compute sample means from the bootstrap samples boot_means &lt;- bootstrap_samples |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) For simplicity, we combine these two operations into a single chain of pipe (|&gt;) operators: boot_means &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) boot_means # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 990 more rows The data frame boot_means contains 1000 sample mean weights, each obtained from a different bootstrap sample. In Figure 8.11 the histogram of these 1000 sample means weights is presented. ggplot(boot_means, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;sample mean weight in grams&quot;) FIGURE 8.11: Histogram of 1000 bootstrap sample mean weights of almonds. The histogram is a graphical approximation of the bootstrap distribution of the sample mean. This distribution is constructed by getting all the sample means from every possible bootstrap sample constructed based on the original sample. Since the total number of possible bootstrap is really large, we have not used all of them here, but 100 of them that already provide a good visual approximation. Observe also that the bootstrap distribution itself can approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean, a concept we studied in Chapter 7 where we took multiple samples from the population. The key difference here is that we resample form a single sample, the original sample, not from the entire population. By inspecting the histogram in Figure 8.11, the bell shape is apparent. We can also approximate the center or the spread of this distribution by computing the mean or the standard deviation of these 1000 bootstrap sample means: boot_means |&gt; summarize(mean_of_means = mean(mean_weight), sd_of_means = sd(mean_weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 mean_of_means sd_of_means &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.67998 0.0356615 Everything we learned in Chapter 7 when studying the sampling distribution of the sample mean applies here. For example, observe that the mean of these bootstrap sample means is 3.68 grams, very close to the mean of the original sample: 3.68 grams. However, our intention is not to study the distribution of the bootstrap samples, rather to use them to help us estimate population values, such as the population mean. In the next section, we discuss how can we use these bootstrap samples to construct confidence intervals. Learning check (LC8.1) What is the chief difference between a bootstrap distribution and a sampling distribution? (LC8.2) Looking at the bootstrap distribution for the sample mean in Figure 8.11, between what two values would you say most values lie? 8.3.2 Confidence intervals and the bootstrap: original workflow The process of obtaining bootstrap samples and using them for estimation is called bootstrapping. We can estimate population parameters such as the mean, median, or standard deviation. We can also construct confidence intervals. In this subsection, we focus on the latter and construct confidence intervals based on bootstrap samples. For this, we review the R syntax and workflow we have already used in previous section and also introduce a new package: the infer package for “tidy” and transparent statistical inference. 8.3.2.1 Original workflow Recall that in Section 8.3.1.2, we obtained bootstrap samples, then calculate the sample means from these samples. Let us revisit the original workflow using dplyr verbs and the |&gt; pipe operator. First, we use the rep_sample_n() function to resample from the original sample almonds_sample_100 of 5000 almonds. We set size = 100 to general bootstrap samples of the same size as the original sample and we resample with replacement by setting replace = TRUE. We create 1000 bootstrap samples by setting reps = 1000: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) Second, we add another pipe followed by using summarize() to compute the sample mean() weight for each replicate: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) For this simple case, all we needed was to use the rep_sample_n() function and a dplyr verb. However, using only dplyr verbs provides us with a limited set of tools that is not ideal when working with more complicated situations. This is the reason we introduce the infer package. 8.3.3 The infer package workflow: The infer package is an R package for statistical inference. It makes efficient use of the |&gt; pipe operator we introduced in Section 3.1 to spell out the sequence of steps necessary to perform statistical inference in a “tidy” and transparent fashion. Just as the dplyr package provides functions with verb-like names to perform data wrangling, the infer package provides functions with intuitive verb-like names to perform statistical inference, such as constructing confidence intervals or performing hypothesis testing. We have discussed the theory-based implementation of the former in section 8.2.3 and we introduce the latter in Chapter 9. Using the example of almonds’ weights, we introduce infer first by comparing its implementation with dplyr. Recall that to calculate a sample statistic or point estimate from a sample, such as the sample mean, when using dplyr we use summarize() and mean() almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(stat = mean(weight)) If we want to use infer instead, we use the functions specify() and calculate() as shown below: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) The new structure using infer seems slightly more complicated than the one using dplyr for this simple calculation, but these functions will provide three chief benefits moving forward. First, the infer verb names better align with the overall resampling framework you need to understand to construct confidence intervals and to conduct hypothesis tests (in Chapter 9). We will see flowchart diagrams of this framework in the upcoming Figure 8.17 and in Chapter 9 with Figure 9.10. Second, you can transition seamlessly between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing with minimal changes to your code. This becomes apparent in Subsection 9.3.2 when we compare the infer code for both of these inferential methods. Third, the infer workflow is much simpler for conducting inference when you have more than one variable. We introduce two-sample inference where the sample data is collected from two groups, such as in Section 8.5 where we study the contagiousness of yawning and in Section 9.1 where we compare promotion rates of two groups at banks in the 1970s. Then in Section 10.4, we see situations of inference for regression using the regression models you fit in Chapter 5. We now illustrate the sequence of verbs necessary to construct a confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\), the population mean weight of almonds. 1. specify variables FIGURE 8.12: Diagram of the specify() verb. As shown in Figure 8.12, the specify() function is used to choose which variables in a data frame are the focus of our statistical inference. We do this by specifying the response argument. For example, in our almonds_sample_100 data frame of the 100 almonds sampled from the bowl, the variable of interest is weight: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 100 × 1 weight &lt;dbl&gt; 1 4.2 2 4.2 3 3.9 4 3.8 5 3.3 6 3.5 7 4 8 3.5 9 4.2 10 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows Notice how the data itself does not change, but the Response: weight (numeric) meta-data does. This is similar to how the group_by() verb from dplyr doesn’t change the data, but only adds “grouping” meta-data, as we saw in Section 3.4. We can also specify which variables are the focus of the study by introducing a formula = y ~ x in specify(). This is the same formula notation you saw in Chapters 5 and 6 on regression models: the response variable y is separated from the explanatory variable x by a ~ (“tilde”). The following use of specify() with the formula argument yields the same result seen previously: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(formula = weight ~ NULL) Since in the case of almonds we only have a response variable and no explanatory variable of interest, we set the x on the right-hand side of the ~ to be NULL. In cases where inference is focused on a single sample, as it is the almonds’ weights example, either specification works. In examples we present in future sections, the formula specification is simpler and more flexible. In particular, this comes up in the upcoming Section 8.5 on comparing two proportions and Section 10.4 on inference for regression. 2. generate replicates FIGURE 8.13: Diagram of generate() replicates. After we specify() the variables of interest, we pipe the results into the generate() function to generate replicates. This is the function that produces the bootstrap samples or performs similar resampling process a large number of times, based on the variable(s) specified previously, as shown in Figure 8.13 . Recall in Section 8.3.1.2 we did this 1000 times. The generate() function’s first argument is reps, which sets the number of replicates we would like to generate. Since we want to resample the 100 almonds in almonds_sample_100 with replacement 1000 times, we set reps = 1000. The second argument type determines the type of computer simulation used. Setting this to type = \"bootstrap\" produces bootstrap samples using resampling with replacement. We present different options for type in Chapter 9. almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 25,000 × 2 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.8 2 1 2.9 3 1 3.6 4 1 3.4 5 1 3.8 6 1 3.6 7 1 4 8 1 3.2 9 1 3.6 10 1 3.2 # ℹ 24,990 more rows Observe that the resulting data frame has 100,000 rows. This is because we have obtained 1000 bootstrap samples, each with 100 rows. The variable replicate indicates the bootstrap sample each row belongs to, from 1 to 1000, each replicate repeated 100 times. The default value of the type argument is \"bootstrap\" in this scenario, so the inclusion was only made for completeness. If the last line was written simply as generate(reps = 1000), the result would be the same. Comparing with original workflow: Note that the steps of the infer workflow so far produce the same results as the original workflow using the rep_sample_n() function we saw earlier. In other words, the following two code chunks produce similar results: # infer workflow: # Original workflow: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, generate(reps = 1000) reps = 1000) 3. calculate summary statistics FIGURE 8.14: Diagram of calculate() summary statistics. After we generate() 1000 bootstrap samples, we want to summarize each of them, for example, by obtaining the sample mean of each one of them. As the diagram shows, the calculate() function does this. In our example, we calculate the mean weight for each bootstrap sample by setting the stat argument equal to \"mean\" inside the calculate() function. The stat argument can be used for other common summary statistics such as \"median\", \"sum\", \"sd\" (standard deviation), and \"prop\" (proportion). To see a list of all possible summary statistics you can use, type ?calculate and read the help file. Let’s save the result in a data frame called bootstrap_means and explore its contents: bootstrap_means &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) bootstrap_means Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that the resulting data frame has 1000 rows and 2 columns corresponding to the 1000 replicate values. It also has the mean weight for each bootstrap sample saved in the variable stat. Comparing with original workflow: You may have recognized at this point that the calculate() step in the infer workflow produces the same output as the summarize() step in the original workflow. # infer workflow: # Original workflow: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, generate(reps = 1000) |&gt; reps = 1000) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) summarize(stat = mean(weight)) 4. visualize the results FIGURE 8.15: Diagram of visualize() results. The visualize() verb provides a quick way to visualize the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the numerical stat variable’s values. The pipeline of the main infer verbs used for exploring bootstrap distribution results is shown in Figure 8.15. visualize(bootstrap_means) FIGURE 8.16: Bootstrap distribution. Comparing with original workflow: In fact, visualize() is a wrapper function for the ggplot() function that uses a geom_histogram() layer. Recall that we illustrated the concept of a wrapper function in Figure 5.5 in Subsection 5.1.2. # infer workflow: # Original workflow: visualize(bootstrap_means) ggplot(bootstrap_means, aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram() The visualize() function can take many other arguments to customize the plot further. In future section we take advantage of this flexibility. In addition, it works with helper functions to add shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values. We have introduced the different elements on the infer workflow for constructing a bootstrap distribution and visualizing it. A summary of these steps is presented in Figure 8.17. FIGURE 8.17: infer package workflow for confidence intervals. 8.3.4 Confidence intervals using bootstrap samples with infer We are ready to introduce confidence intervals using the bootstrap via infer. We present two different methods for constructing 95% confidence intervals as interval estimates of an unknown population parameter: the percentile method and the standard error method. Let’s now check out the infer package code that explicitly constructs these. There are also some additional neat functions to visualize the resulting confidence intervals built-in to the infer package. 8.3.4.1 Percentile method Recall that in Subsection 8.3.3 we have generated 1000 bootrstrap samples and store them in data frame bootstrap_means: bootstrap_means Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 990 more rows The sample means stored in bootstrap_means represent a good approximation to the bootstrap distribution of all possible bootstrap samples. The percentile method for constructing 95% confidence intervals sets the lower endpoint of the confidence interval at the 2.5th percentile of bootstrap_means and similarly sets the upper endpoint at the 97.5th percentile. The resulting interval captures the middle 95% of the values of the sample mean weights of almonds in bootstrap_means. This is the interval estimate of the population mean weight of almonds in the entire bowl. We can compute the 95% confidence interval by piping bootstrap_means into the get_confidence_interval() function from the infer package, with the confidence level set to 0.95 and the confidence interval type to be \"percentile\". We save the results in percentile_ci. percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_means |&gt; get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) percentile_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61198 3.756 Alternatively, we can visualize the interval (3.61, 3.76) by piping the bootstrap_means data frame into the visualize() function and adding a shade_confidence_interval() layer. We set the endpoints argument to be percentile_ci. visualize(bootstrap_means) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci) FIGURE 8.18: Percentile method 95% confidence interval shaded corresponding to potential values. Observe in Figure 8.18 that 95% of the sample means stored in the stat variable in bootstrap_means fall between the two endpoints marked with the darker lines, with 2.5% of the sample means to the left of the shaded area and 2.5% of the sample means to the right. You also have the option to change the colors of the shading using the color and fill arguments. The infer package has incorporated a shorter named function shade_ci() that produces the same results. Try out the following code: visualize(bootstrap_means) + shade_ci(endpoints = percentile_ci, color = &quot;hotpink&quot;, fill = &quot;khaki&quot;) 8.3.4.2 Standard error method In Subsection 8.2.3 we introduced theory-based confidence intervals. We show that a 95% confidence interval can be constructed as \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\cdot SE_{\\bar x}, \\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\cdot SE_{\\bar x}\\right)\\] where \\(\\overline{x}\\) is the sample mean of the original sample, 1.96 is the number of standard errors around the mean needed to account for 95% of the area under the density curve (when the distribution is normal), and \\(SE_{\\bar x}\\) is the standard error of the sample mean that can be obtained as \\(\\sigma /\\sqrt{n}\\) if the population standard deviation is known, or estimated as \\(s/\\sqrt{n}\\) if we have to use the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), and the sample size, \\(n\\). We use the same structure to construct confidence intervals but using the bootstrap sample means to estimate the standard error of \\(\\overline{x}\\). Thus, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), using the standard error estimated via bootrapping, \\(SE_\\text{boot}\\) is: \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\cdot SE_{\\text{boot}}, \\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\cdot SE_{\\text{boot}}\\right)\\] We can obtain this confidence interval using dplyr. First, we calculate the estimated standard error: SE_boot &lt;- bootstrap_means |&gt; summarize(SE = sd(stat)) |&gt; pull(SE) SE_boot [1] 0.0357 and then use the original sample mean to obtain the 95% confidence interval: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(lower_bound = mean(weight) - 1.96*SE_boot, upper_bound = mean(weight) + 1.96*SE_boot) # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_bound upper_bound &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61210 3.75190 Alternatively, computation of the 95% confidence interval can once again be done via infer. We obtain the sample mean of the original sample and store it in variable x_bar x_bar &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) x_bar Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.682 Now, we pipe the bootstrap_means data frame we created into the get_confidence_interval() function. We set the type argument to be \"se\" and specify the point_estimate argument to be x_bar in order to set the center of the confidence interval to the sample mean of the original sample. standard_error_ci &lt;- bootstrap_means |&gt; get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = x_bar) Using `level = 0.95` to compute confidence interval. standard_error_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61210 3.75190 The results is the same whether dplyr or infer is used, but as explained earlier, the latter provides more flexbility for other tests. If we would like to visualize the interval (3.61, 3.75), we can once again pipe the bootstrap_means data frame into the visualize() function and add a shade_confidence_interval() layer to our plot. We set the endpoints argument to be standard_error_ci. The resulting standard-error method based on a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) can be seen in Figure 8.19. visualize(bootstrap_means) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = standard_error_ci) FIGURE 8.19: Standard-error-method 95% confidence interval. Because we are using bootstrap samples to construct these intervals, we call the percentile and standard error methods simulation-based methods. We can compare the 95% confidence intervals obtained using both simulation-based methods as well as the one obtained using the theory-based method described in 8.2.3: Percentile method: (3.61, 3.76) Standard error method: (3.61, 3.75) Theory-based method: (3.61, 3.75) 8.3.4.3 Percentile-\\(t\\) method 8.3.4.4 Bias-corrected and accelerated, BCa, method Learning check (LC8.3) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the median weight of minting of all US almonds.

Let’s apply our knowledge of confidence intervals to answer the question: “Is yawning contagious?”. If you see someone else yawn, are you more likely to yawn? In an episode of the US show Mythbusters that aired on Discovery, the hosts conducted an experiment to answer this question. More information about the episode is available on IMDb. 8.5.1 Mythbusters study data Fifty adult participants who thought they were being considered for an appearance on the show were interviewed by a show recruiter. In the interview, the recruiter either yawned or did not. Participants then sat by themselves in a large van and were asked to wait. While in the van, the Mythbusters team watched the participants using a hidden camera to see if they yawned. The data frame containing the results of their experiment is available in the mythbusters_yawn data frame included in the moderndive package: mythbusters_yawn # A tibble: 50 × 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 seed yes 2 2 control yes 3 3 seed no 4 4 seed yes 5 5 seed no 6 6 control no 7 7 seed yes 8 8 control no 9 9 control no 10 10 seed no # ℹ 40 more rows The variables are: subj: The participant ID with values 1 through 50. group: A binary treatment variable indicating whether the participant was exposed to yawning. \"seed\" indicates the participant was exposed to yawning while \"control\" indicates the participant was not. yawn: A binary response variable indicating whether the participant ultimately yawned. Recall that you learned about treatment and response variables in Subsection 5.3.1 in our discussion on confounding variables. Let’s use some data wrangling to obtain counts of the four possible outcomes: mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% group_by(group, yawn) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;group&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. # A tibble: 4 × 3 # Groups: group [2] group yawn count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 control no 12 2 control yes 4 3 seed no 24 4 seed yes 10 Let’s first focus on the \"control\" group participants who were not exposed to yawning. 12 such participants did not yawn, while 4 such participants did. So out of the 16 people who were not exposed to yawning, 4/16 = 0.25 = 25% did yawn. Let’s now focus on the \"seed\" group participants who were exposed to yawning where 24 such participants did not yawn, while 10 such participants did yawn. So out of the 34 people who were exposed to yawning, 10/34 = 0.294 = 29.4% did yawn. Comparing these two percentages, the participants who were exposed to yawning yawned 29.4% - 25% = 4.4% more often than those who were not. 8.5.2 Sampling scenario Let’s review the terminology and notation related to sampling we studied in Subsection 7.2.1. In Chapter 7 our study population was the bowl of \\(N\\) = 2400 balls. Our population parameter of interest was the population proportion of these balls that were red, denoted mathematically by \\(p\\). In order to estimate \\(p\\), we extracted a sample of 50 balls using the shovel and computed the relevant point estimate: the sample proportion that were red, denoted mathematically by \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Who is the study population here? All humans? All the people who watch the show Mythbusters? It’s hard to say! This question can only be answered if we know how the show’s hosts recruited participants! In other words, what was the sampling methodology used by the Mythbusters to recruit participants? We alas are not provided with this information. Only for the purposes of this case study, however, we’ll assume that the 50 participants are a representative sample of all Americans given the popularity of this show. Thus, we’ll be assuming that any results of this experiment will generalize to all \\(N\\) = 327 million Americans (2018 population). Just like with our sampling bowl, the population parameter here will involve proportions. However, in this case it will be the difference in population proportions \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\), where \\(p_{seed}\\) is the proportion of all Americans who if exposed to yawning will yawn themselves, and \\(p_{control}\\) is the proportion of all Americans who if not exposed to yawning still yawn themselves. Correspondingly, the point estimate/sample statistic based the Mythbusters’ sample of participants will be the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\). Let’s extend Table ?? of scenarios of sampling for inference to include our latest scenario. TABLE 8.1: TABLE 8.2: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) This is known as a two-sample inference situation since we have two separate samples. Based on their two-samples of size \\(n_{seed}\\) = 34 and \\(n_{control}\\) = 16, the point estimate is \\[ \\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control} = \\frac{24}{34} - \\frac{12}{16} = 0.04411765 \\approx 4.4\\% \\] However, say the Mythbusters repeated this experiment. In other words, say they recruited 50 new participants and exposed 34 of them to yawning and 16 not. Would they obtain the exact same estimated difference of 4.4%? Probably not, again, because of sampling variation. How does this sampling variation affect their estimate of 4.4%? In other words, what would be a plausible range of values for this difference that accounts for this sampling variation? We can answer this question with confidence intervals! Furthermore, since the Mythbusters only have a single two-sample of 50 participants, they would have to construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) using bootstrap resampling with replacement. We make a couple of important notes. First, for the comparison between the \"seed\" and \"control\" groups to make sense, however, both groups need to be independent from each other. Otherwise, they could influence each other’s results. This means that a participant being selected for the \"seed\" or \"control\" group has no influence on another participant being assigned to one of the two groups. As an example, if there were a mother and her child as participants in the study, they wouldn’t necessarily be in the same group. They would each be assigned randomly to one of the two groups of the explanatory variable. Second, the order of the subtraction in the difference doesn’t matter so long as you are consistent and tailor your interpretations accordingly. In other words, using a point estimate of \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) or \\(\\widehat{p}_{control} - \\widehat{p}_{seed}\\) does not make a material difference, you just need to stay consistent and interpret your results accordingly. 8.5.3 Constructing the confidence interval As we did in Subsection 8.3.3, let’s first construct the bootstrap distribution for \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) and then use this to construct 95% confidence intervals for \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\). We’ll do this using the infer workflow again. However, since the difference in proportions is a new scenario for inference, we’ll need to use some new arguments in the infer functions along the way. 1. specify variables Let’s take our mythbusters_yawn data frame and specify() which variables are of interest using the y ~ x formula interface where: Our response variable is yawn: whether or not a participant yawned. It has levels \"yes\" and \"no\". The explanatory variable is group: whether or not a participant was exposed to yawning. It has levels \"seed\" (exposed to yawning) and \"control\" (not exposed to yawning). mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group) Error: A level of the response variable `yawn` needs to be specified for the `success` argument in `specify()`. Alas, we got an error message similar to the one from Subsection ??: infer is telling us that one of the levels of the categorical variable yawn needs to be defined as the success. Recall that we define success to be the event of interest we are trying to count and compute proportions of. Are we interested in those participants who \"yes\" yawned or those who \"no\" didn’t yawn? This isn’t clear to R or someone just picking up the code and results for the first time, so we need to set the success argument to \"yes\" as follows to improve the transparency of the code: mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) Response: yawn (factor) Explanatory: group (factor) # A tibble: 50 × 2 yawn group &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 yes seed 2 yes control 3 no seed 4 yes seed 5 no seed 6 no control 7 yes seed 8 no control 9 no control 10 no seed # ℹ 40 more rows 2. generate replicates Our next step is to perform bootstrap resampling with replacement like we did with the slips of paper in our pennies activity in Section ??. We saw how it works with both a single variable in computing bootstrap means in Section 8.3.2 and in computing bootstrap proportions in Section ??, but we haven’t yet worked with bootstrapping involving multiple variables. In the infer package, bootstrapping with multiple variables means that each row is potentially resampled. Let’s investigate this by focusing only on the first six rows of mythbusters_yawn: first_six_rows &lt;- head(mythbusters_yawn) first_six_rows # A tibble: 6 × 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 seed yes 2 2 control yes 3 3 seed no 4 4 seed yes 5 5 seed no 6 6 control no When we bootstrap this data, we are potentially pulling the subject’s readings multiple times. Thus, we could see the entries of \"seed\" for group and \"no\" for yawn together in a new row in a bootstrap sample. This is further seen by exploring the sample_n() function in dplyr on this smaller 6-row data frame comprised of head(mythbusters_yawn). The sample_n() function can perform this bootstrapping procedure and is similar to the rep_sample_n() function in infer, except that it is not repeated, but rather only performs one sample with or without replacement. first_six_rows %&gt;% sample_n(size = 6, replace = TRUE) # A tibble: 6 × 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 4 seed yes 2 4 seed yes 3 2 control yes 4 5 seed no 5 3 seed no 6 1 seed yes We can see that in this bootstrap sample generated from the first six rows of mythbusters_yawn, we have some rows repeated. The same is true when we perform the generate() step in infer as done in what follows. Using this fact, we generate 1000 replicates, or, in other words, we bootstrap resample the 50 participants with replacement 1000 times. mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) Response: yawn (factor) Explanatory: group (factor) # A tibble: 50,000 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate yawn group &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 1 yes seed 2 1 yes control 3 1 no control 4 1 no control 5 1 yes seed 6 1 yes seed 7 1 yes seed 8 1 yes seed 9 1 no seed 10 1 yes seed # ℹ 49,990 more rows Observe that the resulting data frame has 50,000 rows. This is because we performed resampling of 50 participants with replacement 1000 times and 50,000 = 1000 \\(\\cdot\\) 50. The variable replicate indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value 1 50 times, the value 2 50 times, all the way through to the value 1000 50 times. 3. calculate summary statistics After we generate() many replicates of bootstrap resampling with replacement, we next want to summarize the bootstrap resamples of size 50 with a single summary statistic, the difference in proportions. We do this by setting the stat argument to \"diff in props\": mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;) Error: Statistic is based on a difference; specify the `order` in which to subtract the levels of the explanatory variable. We see another error here. We need to specify the order of the subtraction. Is it \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) or \\(\\widehat{p}_{control} - \\widehat{p}_{seed}\\). We specify it to be \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) by setting order = c(\"seed\", \"control\"). Note that you could’ve also set order = c(\"control\", \"seed\"). As we stated earlier, the order of the subtraction does not matter, so long as you stay consistent throughout your analysis and tailor your interpretations accordingly. Let’s save the output in a data frame bootstrap_distribution_yawning: bootstrap_distribution_yawning &lt;- mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) bootstrap_distribution_yawning # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.0357143 2 2 0.229167 3 3 0.00952381 4 4 0.0106952 5 5 0.00483092 6 6 0.00793651 7 7 -0.0845588 8 8 -0.00466200 9 9 0.164686 10 10 0.124777 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that the resulting data frame has 1000 rows and 2 columns corresponding to the 1000 replicate ID’s and the 1000 differences in proportions for each bootstrap resample in stat. 4. visualize the results In Figure 8.20 we visualize() the resulting bootstrap resampling distribution. Let’s also add a vertical line at 0 by adding a geom_vline() layer. visualize(bootstrap_distribution_yawning) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0) FIGURE 8.20: Bootstrap distribution. First, let’s compute the 95% confidence interval for \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) using the percentile method, in other words, by identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles which include the middle 95% of values. Recall that this method does not require the bootstrap distribution to be normally shaped. bootstrap_distribution_yawning %&gt;% get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;percentile&quot;, level = 0.95) # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.238276 0.302464 Second, since the bootstrap distribution is roughly bell-shaped, we can construct a confidence interval using the standard error method as well. Recall that to construct a confidence interval using the standard error method, we need to specify the center of the interval using the point_estimate argument. In our case, we need to set it to be the difference in sample proportions of 4.4% that the Mythbusters observed. We can also use the infer workflow to compute this value by excluding the generate() 1000 bootstrap replicates step. In other words, do not generate replicates, but rather use only the original sample data. We can achieve this by commenting out the generate() line, telling R to ignore it: obs_diff_in_props &lt;- mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% # generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) obs_diff_in_props Response: yawn (factor) Explanatory: group (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0441176 We thus plug this value in as the point_estimate argument. myth_ci_se &lt;- bootstrap_distribution_yawning %&gt;% get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = obs_diff_in_props) Using `level = 0.95` to compute confidence interval. myth_ci_se # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.227291 0.315526 Let’s visualize both confidence intervals in Figure 8.21, with the percentile-method interval marked with black lines and the standard-error-method marked with grey lines. Observe that they are both similar to each other. FIGURE 8.21: Two 95% confidence intervals: percentile method (black) and standard error method (grey). 8.5.4 Interpreting the confidence interval Given that both confidence intervals are quite similar, let’s focus our interpretation to only the percentile-method confidence interval of (-0.238, 0.302). Recall from Subsection ?? that the precise statistical interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is: if this construction procedure is repeated 100 times, then we expect about 95 of the confidence intervals to capture the true value of \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\). In other words, if we gathered 100 samples of \\(n\\) = 50 participants from a similar pool of people and constructed 100 confidence intervals each based on each of the 100 samples, about 95 of them will contain the true value of \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) while about five won’t. Given that this is a little long winded, we use the shorthand interpretation: we’re 95% “confident” that the true difference in proportions \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) is between (-0.238, 0.302). There is one value of particular interest that this 95% confidence interval contains: zero. If \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) were equal to 0, then there would be no difference in proportion yawning between the two groups. This would suggest that there is no associated effect of being exposed to a yawning recruiter on whether you yawn yourself. In our case, since the 95% confidence interval includes 0, we cannot conclusively say if either proportion is larger. Of our 1000 bootstrap resamples with replacement, sometimes \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed}\\) was higher and thus those exposed to yawning yawned themselves more often. At other times, the reverse happened. Say, on the other hand, the 95% confidence interval was entirely above zero. This would suggest that \\(p_{seed} - p_{control} &gt; 0\\), or, in other words \\(p_{seed} &gt; p_{control}\\), and thus we’d have evidence suggesting those exposed to yawning do yawn more often. 8.6 Summary and Final Remarks 8.6.1 Additional resources If you want more examples of the infer workflow to construct confidence intervals, we suggest you check out the infer package homepage, in particular, a series of example analyses available at https://infer.netlify.app/articles/. 8.6.2 What’s to come? Now that we’ve equipped ourselves with confidence intervals, in Chapter 9 we’ll cover the other common tool for statistical inference: hypothesis testing. Just like confidence intervals, hypothesis tests are used to infer about a population using a sample. However, we’ll see that the framework for making such inferences is slightly different. "],["9-hypothesis-testing.html", "Chapter 9 Hypothesis Testing 9.1 Music popularity activity 9.2 Understanding hypothesis tests 9.3 Conducting hypothesis tests 9.4 Interpreting hypothesis tests 9.5 Case study: Are action or romance movies rated higher? 9.6 Conclusion", " Chapter 9 Hypothesis Testing Now that we’ve studied confidence intervals in Chapter 8, let’s study another commonly used method for statistical inference: hypothesis testing. Hypothesis tests allow us to take a sample of data from a population and infer about the plausibility of competing hypotheses. For example, in the upcoming music popularity activity by genre in Section 9.1, you’ll study data collected from Spotify to investigate whether metal music is more popular than deep-house music. The good news is we’ve already covered many of the necessary concepts to understand hypothesis testing in Chapters 7 and 8. We will expand further on these ideas here and also provide a general framework for understanding hypothesis tests. By understanding this general framework, you’ll be able to adapt it to many different scenarios. The same can be said for confidence intervals. There was one general framework that applies to confidence intervals, and the infer package was designed around this framework. While the specifics may change slightly for different types of confidence intervals, the general framework stays the same. We believe that this approach is much better for long-term learning than focusing on specific details for specific confidence intervals using theory-based approaches. As you’ll now see, we prefer this general framework for hypothesis tests as well. If you’d like more practice or you’re curious to see how this framework applies to different scenarios, you can find fully-worked out examples for many common hypothesis tests and their corresponding confidence intervals in Appendix B. We recommend that you carefully review these examples as they also cover how the general frameworks apply to traditional theory-based methods like the \\(t\\)-test and normal-theory confidence intervals. You’ll see there that these traditional methods are just approximations for the computer-based methods we’ve been focusing on. However, they also require conditions to be met for their results to be valid. Computer-based methods using randomization, simulation, and bootstrapping have much fewer restrictions. Furthermore, they help develop your computational thinking, which is one big reason they are emphasized throughout this book. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Recall from our discussion in Section 4.4 that loading the tidyverse package by running library(tidyverse) loads the following commonly used data science packages all at once: ggplot2 for data visualization dplyr for data wrangling tidyr for converting data to “tidy” format readr for importing spreadsheet data into R As well as the more advanced purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats packages If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(infer) library(moderndive) library(nycflights23) library(ggplot2movies) 9.1 Music popularity activity Let’s start with an activity studying the effect of music genre on Spotify song popularity. 9.1.1 Is metal music more popular than deep house music? Imagine you’re a music analyst for Spotify, and you’re curious about whether fans of metal or deep house are more passionate about their favorite genres. You want to determine if there’s a significant difference in the popularity of these two genres. Popularity, in this case, is measured by Spotify, say, as the average number of streams and recent user interactions on tracks classified under each genre. (Note that Spotify doesn’t actually disclose how this metric is calculated, so we have to take our best guess.) This question sets the stage for our exploration into hypothesis testing. Metal music, characterized by its aggressive sounds, powerful vocals, and complex instrumentals, has cultivated a loyal fanbase that often prides itself on its deep appreciation for the genre’s intensity and technical skill. On the other hand, deep house music, with its smooth, soulful rhythms and steady beats, attracts listeners who enjoy the genre’s calming and immersive vibe, often associated with late-night clubs and chill-out sessions. By comparing the popularity metrics between these two genres, we can determine if one truly resonates more with listeners on Spotify. This exploration not only deepens our understanding of musical preferences but also serves as a practical introduction to the principles of hypothesis testing. To begin the analysis, 2000 were selected at random from Spotify’s song archive. We’ll use “song” and “track” interchangeably going forward. There were 1000 metal tracks and 1000 deep house tracks selected. The moderndive package contains the data on the songs by genre in the spotify_by_genre data frame. There are six genres selected in that data (country, deep-house, dubstep, hip-hop, metal, and rock). You’ll have the opportunity to explore relationships with the other genres and popularity in the Learning Checks. Let’s explore this data by focusing on just metal and deep-house by looking at twelve randomly selected rows and our columns of interest. Note here that we also group our selection so that three songs of each of the four possible groupings of track_genre and popular_or_not are selected. spotify_metal_deephouse &lt;- spotify_by_genre |&gt; filter(track_genre %in% c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) |&gt; select(track_id, track_genre, artists, track_name, popularity, popular_or_not) spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; group_by(track_genre, popular_or_not) |&gt; sample_n(size = 3) |&gt; arrange(track_id) # A tibble: 12 × 6 track_id track_genre artists track_name popularity popular_or_not &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 14VmsVz9jMLnTvc6Gtd… deep-house LYOD;T… On My Way 51 popular 2 1uK6lSRKWd9T5FNBVp6… deep-house Sunmoon Just the … 52 popular 3 2Eo5TuDu2fPROZ3ro7h… deep-house Tensna… Latching … 51 popular 4 2MvIMgtWyK88OiPi0J8… metal Slipkn… Psychosoc… 66 popular 5 2RrgY5XzFmlLtq2jDsi… deep-house BCX Miracle I… 41 not popular 6 31IfnfvSlw299vYoAic… metal blesst… I Wouldn&#39;… 0 not popular 7 3AJmjefnCKNq2Vtib5q… deep-house Junge … I&#39;m The O… 49 not popular 8 3KXW97hQNrLiObudx0b… metal Poison Every Ros… 0 not popular 9 3eMOYZRLqXMBw9aqaFR… metal Armore… S.O.S. 54 popular 10 3txlbadheKtYDsywCln… deep-house James … Good Luck… 47 not popular 11 5toE2GI4iMIpelQtzKN… metal Hollyw… Riot 26 not popular 12 7HjNOz8Y7H7uSySXuHN… metal Breaki… Ashes of … 61 popular The variable track_id acts as an identification variable for all 2000 rows, the track_genre variable indicates what genre the song is classified under, the artists and track_name columns provide additional information about the track by providing the artist and the name of the song, popularity is the metric mentioned earlier given by Spotify, and popular_or_not is a categorical representation of the popularity column with any value of 50 (the 75th percentile of popularity) referring to popular and anything at or below 50 as not_popular. The decision made by the authors to call a song “popular” if it is above the 75th percentile (3rd quartile) of popularity is arbitrary and could be changed to any other value.) Let’s perform an exploratory data analysis of the relationship between the two categorical variables track_genre and popular_or_not. Recall that we saw in Subsection 2.8.3 that one way we can visualize such a relationship is by using a stacked barplot. ggplot(spotify_metal_deephouse, aes(x = track_genre, fill = popular_or_not)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = &quot;Genre of track&quot;) FIGURE 9.1: Barplot relating genre to popularity. Observe in Figure 9.1 that, in this sample, metal songs are only slightly more popular than deep house songs by looking at the height of the popular bars. Let’s quantify these popularity rates by computing the proportion of songs classified as popular for each of the two genres using the dplyr package for data wrangling. Note the use of the tally() function here which is a shortcut for summarize(n = n()) to get counts. spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; group_by(track_genre, popular_or_not) |&gt; tally() # Same as summarize(n = n()) # A tibble: 4 × 3 # Groups: track_genre [2] track_genre popular_or_not n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 deep-house not popular 471 2 deep-house popular 529 3 metal not popular 437 4 metal popular 563 So of the 1000 metal songs, 563 were popular, for a proportion of 563/1000 = 0.563 = 56.3%. On the other hand, of the 1000 deep house songs, 529 were popular, for a proportion of 529/1000 = 0.529 = 52.9%. Comparing these two rates of promotion, it appears that metal songs were popular at a rate 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4% higher than deep house songs. This is suggestive of an advantage for metal songs in terms of popularity. The question is, however, does this provide conclusive evidence that there is greater popularity for metal songs compared to deep house songs? Could a difference in popularity rates of 3.4% still occur by chance, even in a hypothetical world where no difference in popularity existed between the two genres? In other words, what is the role of sampling variation in this hypothesized world? To answer this question, we’ll again rely on a computer to run simulations. 9.1.2 Shuffling once First, try to imagine a hypothetical universe where difference in the popularity of metal and deep house songs existed. In such a hypothetical universe, the genre of a song would have no bearing on their chances of popularity. Bringing things back to our spotify_metal_deephouse data frame, the popular_or_not variable would thus be an irrelevant label. If these popular_or_not labels were irrelevant, then we could randomly reassign them by “shuffling” them to no consequence! To illustrate this idea, let’s narrow our focus to 52 chosen songs of the 2000 that you saw earlier. The track_genre column shows what the original genre of the song was. Note that to keep this smaller data set of 52 rows to be a representative sample of the 2000 rows, we have sampled such that the popularity rate for each of metal and deep-house is close to the original rates of 0.563 and 0.529, respectively, prior to shuffling. This data is available in the spotify_52_original data frame in the moderndive package. spotify_52_original # A tibble: 52 × 6 track_id track_genre artists track_name popularity popular_or_not &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 3fvsxmytTns1ApIWBqf… deep-house Jess B… Temptatio… 63 popular 2 6Nd6ntkzr4t8o1FKPGO… metal Whites… Here I Go… 69 popular 3 7MIKwg3dDCWhxMVjMvq… metal Blind … No Rain 1 not popular 4 1fQaoh3imrMunWVZh5k… metal Avenge… Shepherd … 70 popular 5 2O0vM6F7VMXf66Y5qUu… deep-house Nora V… I Wanna D… 56 popular 6 7HjNOz8Y7H7uSySXuHN… metal Breaki… Ashes of … 61 popular 7 577MNC3o3L0lNIzx9ab… metal Bon Jo… Thank You… 67 popular 8 5KtlHyEw7BMr1uSw2eG… deep-house Starle… Arms Arou… 55 popular 9 7bXWSg5gd0Em0eQ5xpt… deep-house The Hi… I Wonder 43 not popular 10 4nzIpIeHWiuFQnOV5ZE… metal Defton… Ohms 0 not popular # ℹ 42 more rows In our hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity, popularity is irrelevant and thus it is of no consequence to randomly “shuffle” the values of popular_or_not. The popular_or_not column in the spotify_52_shuffled data frame in the moderndive package shows one such possible random shuffling. spotify_52_shuffled # A tibble: 52 × 6 track_id track_genre artists track_name popularity popular_or_not &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 3fvsxmytTns1ApIWBqf… deep-house Jess B… Temptatio… 63 popular 2 6Nd6ntkzr4t8o1FKPGO… metal Whites… Here I Go… 69 not popular 3 7MIKwg3dDCWhxMVjMvq… metal Blind … No Rain 1 popular 4 1fQaoh3imrMunWVZh5k… metal Avenge… Shepherd … 70 not popular 5 2O0vM6F7VMXf66Y5qUu… deep-house Nora V… I Wanna D… 56 popular 6 7HjNOz8Y7H7uSySXuHN… metal Breaki… Ashes of … 61 not popular 7 577MNC3o3L0lNIzx9ab… metal Bon Jo… Thank You… 67 not popular 8 5KtlHyEw7BMr1uSw2eG… deep-house Starle… Arms Arou… 55 not popular 9 7bXWSg5gd0Em0eQ5xpt… deep-house The Hi… I Wonder 43 not popular 10 4nzIpIeHWiuFQnOV5ZE… metal Defton… Ohms 0 not popular # ℹ 42 more rows Observe in the popular_or_not column how the popular and not popular results are now listed in a different order. Some of the original popular now are not popular, some of the not popular are popular, and others are the same as the original. Again, such random shuffling of the popular_or_not label only makes sense in our hypothesized universe of no difference in popularity between genres. Is there a tactile way for us to understand what is going on with this shuffling? One way would be by using standard deck of 52 playing cards, which we display in Figure 9.2. FIGURE 9.2: Standard deck of 52 playing cards. Since we started with equal sample sizes of 1000 songs for each genre, we can think about splitting the deck in half to have 26 cards in two piles (one for metal and another for deep-house). After shuffling these 52 cards as seen in Figure 9.3, we split the deck equally into the two piles of 26 cards each. Then, we can flip the cards over one-by-one, assigning “popular” for each red card and “not popular” for each black card keeping a tally of how many of each genre are popular. FIGURE 9.3: Shuffling a deck of cards. Let’s repeat the same exploratory data analysis we did for the original spotify_metal_deephouse data on our spotify_52_original and spotify_52_shuffled data frames. Let’s create a barplot visualizing the relationship between track_genre and the new shuffled popular_or_not variable, and compare this to the original un-shuffled version in Figure 9.4. ggplot(spotify_52_shuffled, aes(x = track_genre, fill = popular_or_not)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = &quot;Genre of track&quot;) `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;track_genre&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;track_genre&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. FIGURE 9.4: Barplots of relationship of genre with ‘popular or not’ (left) and shuffled ‘popular or not’ (right). The difference in metal versus deep house popularity rates is now different. Compared to the original data in the left barplot, the new “shuffled” data in the right barplot has popularity rates that are actually in the opposite direction as they were originally. This is because the shuffling process has removed any relationship between genre and popularity. Let’s also compute the proportion of tracks that are now “popular” in the popular_or_not column for each genre: spotify_52_shuffled |&gt; group_by(track_genre, popular_or_not) |&gt; tally() # A tibble: 4 × 3 # Groups: track_genre [2] track_genre popular_or_not n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 deep-house not popular 10 2 deep-house popular 16 3 metal not popular 13 4 metal popular 13 So in this one sample of a hypothetical universe of no difference in genre popularity, \\(13/26 = 0.5 = 50\\%\\) of metal songs were popular. On the other hand, \\(16/26 = 0.615 = 61.5\\%\\) of deep house songs were popular. Let’s next compare these two values. It appears that metal tracks were popular at a rate that was \\(0.5 - 0.615 = -0.115 = -11.5\\%\\) different than deep house songs. Observe how this difference in rates is not the same as the difference in rates of 0.034 = 3.4% we originally observed. This is once again due to sampling variation. How can we better understand the effect of this sampling variation? By repeating this shuffling several times! 9.1.3 What did we just do? What we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical procedure known as hypothesis testing using a permutation test. The term “permutation” is the mathematical term for “shuffling”: taking a series of values and reordering them randomly, as you did with the playing cards. In fact, permutations are another form of resampling, like the bootstrap method you performed in Chapter 8. While the bootstrap method involves resampling with replacement, permutation methods involve resampling without replacement. We needn’t stay defined to this dataset of 52 rows only though. It was useful to see how we could use the deck of cards as a way to visualize tactily how the shuffling would assign values of popular or not popular to different songs. These same ideas can be applied to each of the 2000 tracks in our spotify_metal_deephouse data. We can think for this data about an inference about an unknown difference of population proportions with the 2000 tracks being our sample. We denote this as \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\), where \\(p_{m}\\) is the population proportion of songs with metal names being popular and \\(p_{d}\\) is the equivalent for deep house songs. Recall that this is one of the scenarios for inference we’ve seen so far in Table 9.1. TABLE 9.1: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) So, based on our sample of \\(n_m = 1000\\) metal tracks and \\(n_f = 1000\\) deep house tracks, the point estimate for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) is the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} -\\widehat{p}_{f}\\) = 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4%. This difference in favor of metal songs of 0.034 is greater than 0, suggesting metal songs are more popular than deep house songs. However, the question we ask ourselves was “is this difference meaningfully greater than 0?”. In other words, is that difference indicative of true popularity, or can we just attribute it to sampling variation? Hypothesis testing allows us to make such distinctions. 9.2 Understanding hypothesis tests Much like the terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling you saw in Section 7.2, there are a lot of terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis testing as well. Learning these may seem like a very daunting task at first. However, with practice, practice, and more practice, anyone can master them. First, a hypothesis is a statement about the value of an unknown population parameter. In our genre popularity activity, our population parameter of interest is the difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\). Hypothesis tests can involve any of the population parameters in Table ?? of the five inference scenarios we’ll cover in this book and also more advanced types we won’t cover here. Second, a hypothesis test consists of a test between two competing hypotheses: (1) a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) (pronounced “H-naught”) versus (2) an alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) (also denoted \\(H_1\\)). Generally the null hypothesis is a claim that there is “no effect” or “no difference of interest.” In many cases, the null hypothesis represents the status quo or a situation that nothing interesting is happening. Furthermore, generally the alternative hypothesis is the claim the experimenter or researcher wants to establish or find evidence to support. It is viewed as a “challenger” hypothesis to the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). In our genre popularity activity, an appropriate hypothesis test would be: \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: \\text{metal and deep house have the same popularity rate}\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A &amp;: \\text{metal is popular at a higher rate than deep house} \\end{aligned} \\] Note some of the choices we have made. First, we set the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) to be that there is no difference in popularity rate and the “challenger” alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) to be that there is a difference. While it would not be wrong in principle to reverse the two, it is a convention in statistical inference that the null hypothesis is set to reflect a “null” situation where “nothing is going on.” As we discussed earlier, in this case, \\(H_0\\) corresponds to there being no difference in promotion rates. Furthermore, we set \\(H_A\\) to be that metal is popular at a higher rate, a subjective choice reflecting a prior suspicion we have that this is the case. We call such alternative hypotheses one-sided alternatives. If someone else however does not share such suspicions and only wants to investigate that there is a difference, whether higher or lower, they would set what is known as a two-sided alternative. We can re-express the formulation of our hypothesis test using the mathematical notation for our population parameter of interest, the difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A&amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0 \\end{aligned} \\] Observe how the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) is one-sided with \\(p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\). Had we opted for a two-sided alternative, we would have set \\(p_{m} - p_{d} \\neq 0\\). To keep things simple for now, we’ll stick with the simpler one-sided alternative. We’ll present an example of a two-sided alternative in Section 9.5. Third, a test statistic is a point estimate/sample statistic formula used for hypothesis testing. Note that a sample statistic is merely a summary statistic based on a sample of observations. Recall we saw in Section 3.3 that a summary statistic takes in many values and returns only one. Here, the samples would be the \\(n_m = 1000\\) metal songs and the \\(n_f = 1000\\) deep house songs. Hence, the point estimate of interest is the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\). Fourth, the observed test statistic is the value of the test statistic that we observed in real life. In our case, we computed this value using the data saved in the spotify_metal_deephouse data frame. It was the observed difference of \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} -\\widehat{p}_{d} = 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4\\%\\) in favor of metal songs. Fifth, the null distribution is the sampling distribution of the test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Ooof! That’s a long one! Let’s unpack it slowly. The key to understanding the null distribution is that the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is assumed to be true. We’re not saying that \\(H_0\\) is true at this point, we’re only assuming it to be true for hypothesis testing purposes. In our case, this corresponds to our hypothesized universe of no difference in popularity rates. Assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), also stated as “Under \\(H_0\\),” how does the test statistic vary due to sampling variation? In our case, how will the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{f}\\) vary due to sampling under \\(H_0\\)? Recall from Subsection ?? that distributions displaying how point estimates vary due to sampling variation are called sampling distributions. The only additional thing to keep in mind about null distributions is that they are sampling distributions assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Sixth, the \\(p\\)-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Double ooof! Let’s unpack this slowly as well. You can think of the \\(p\\)-value as a quantification of “surprise”: assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, how surprised are we with what we observed? Or in our case, in our hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity, how surprised are we that we observed a difference in popularity rates of 0.034 from our collected samples assuming \\(H_0\\) is true? Very surprised? Somewhat surprised? The \\(p\\)-value quantifies this probability, or what proportion had a more “extreme” result? Here, extreme is defined in terms of the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) that metal applicants are promoted at a higher rate than deep house applicants. In other words, how often was the popularity of metal even more pronounced than \\(0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4\\%\\)? Seventh and lastly, in many hypothesis testing procedures, it is commonly recommended to set the significance level of the test beforehand. It is denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\alpha\\) (pronounced “alpha”). This value acts as a cutoff on the \\(p\\)-value, where if the \\(p\\)-value falls below \\(\\alpha\\), we would “reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).” Alternatively, if the \\(p\\)-value does not fall below \\(\\alpha\\), we would “fail to reject \\(H_0\\).” Note the latter statement is not quite the same as saying we “accept \\(H_0\\).” This distinction is rather subtle and not immediately obvious. So we’ll revisit it later in Section 9.4. While different fields tend to use different values of \\(\\alpha\\), some commonly used values for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.1, 0.01, and 0.05; with 0.05 being the choice people often make without putting much thought into it. We’ll talk more about \\(\\alpha\\) significance levels in Section 9.4, but first let’s fully conduct the hypothesis test corresponding to our genre popularity activity using the infer package. 9.3 Conducting hypothesis tests In Section 8.3.2, we showed you how to construct confidence intervals. We first illustrated how to do this using dplyr data wrangling verbs and the rep_sample_n() function from Subsection ?? which we used as a virtual shovel. In particular, we constructed confidence intervals by resampling with replacement by setting the replace = TRUE argument to the rep_sample_n() function. We then showed you how to perform the same task using the infer package workflow. While both workflows resulted in the same bootstrap distribution from which we can construct confidence intervals, the infer package workflow emphasizes each of the steps in the overall process in Figure 9.5. It does so using function names that are intuitively named with verbs: specify() the variables of interest in your data frame. generate() replicates of bootstrap resamples with replacement. calculate() the summary statistic of interest. visualize() the resulting bootstrap distribution and confidence interval. FIGURE 9.5: Confidence intervals with the infer package. In this section, we’ll now show you how to seamlessly modify the previously seen infer code for constructing confidence intervals to conduct hypothesis tests. You’ll notice that the basic outline of the workflow is almost identical, except for an additional hypothesize() step between the specify() and generate() steps, as can be seen in Figure 9.6. FIGURE 9.6: Hypothesis testing with the infer package. Furthermore, we’ll use a pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1 for this hypothesis test. Let’s leave discussion on the choice of this \\(\\alpha\\) value until later on in Section 9.4. 9.3.1 infer package workflow 1. specify variables Recall that we use the specify() verb to specify the response variable and, if needed, any explanatory variables for our study. In this case, since we are interested in any potential effects of genre on popularity rates, we set popular_or_not as the response variable and track_genre as the explanatory variable. We do so using formula = response ~ explanatory where response is the name of the response variable in the data frame and explanatory is the name of the explanatory variable. So in our case it is popular_or_not ~ track_genre. Furthermore, since we are interested in the proportion of songs \"promoted\", and not the proportion of songs not promoted, we set the argument success to \"promoted\". spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) # A tibble: 2,000 × 2 popular_or_not track_genre &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 popular deep-house 2 popular deep-house 3 popular deep-house 4 popular deep-house 5 popular deep-house 6 popular deep-house 7 popular deep-house 8 popular deep-house 9 popular deep-house 10 popular deep-house # ℹ 1,990 more rows Again, notice how the spotify_metal_deephouse data itself doesn’t change, but the Response: decision (factor) and Explanatory: gender (factor) meta-data do. This is similar to how the group_by() verb from dplyr doesn’t change the data, but only adds “grouping” meta-data, as we saw in Section 3.4. We also now focus on only the two columns of interest in the data for our problem at hand with popular_or_not and track_genre. 2. hypothesize the null In order to conduct hypothesis tests using the infer workflow, we need a new step not present for confidence intervals: hypothesize(). Recall from Section 9.2 that our hypothesis test was \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\\\ \\text{vs. } H_A&amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0 \\end{aligned} \\] In other words, the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) corresponding to our “hypothesized universe” stated that there was no difference in genre popularity rates. We set this null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in our infer workflow using the null argument of the hypothesize() function to either: \"point\" for hypotheses involving a single sample or \"independence\" for hypotheses involving two samples. In our case, since we have two samples (the metal songs and the deep house songs), we set null = \"independence\". spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) Null Hypothesis: independence # A tibble: 2,000 × 2 popular_or_not track_genre &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 popular deep-house 2 popular deep-house 3 popular deep-house 4 popular deep-house 5 popular deep-house 6 popular deep-house 7 popular deep-house 8 popular deep-house 9 popular deep-house 10 popular deep-house # ℹ 1,990 more rows Again, the data has not changed yet. This will occur at the upcoming generate() step; we’re merely setting meta-data for now. Where do the terms \"point\" and \"independence\" come from? These are two technical statistical terms. The term “point” relates from the fact that for a single group of observations, you will test the value of a single point. Going back to the pennies example from Chapter 8, say we wanted to test if the mean weight of all chocolate-covered almonds was equal to 3.5 grams or not. We would be testing the value of a “point” \\(\\mu\\), the mean weight in grams of all chocolate-covered almonds, as follows \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: \\mu = 1993\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A&amp;: \\mu \\neq 3.5 \\end{aligned} \\] The term “independence” relates to the fact that for two groups of observations, you are testing whether or not the response variable is independent of the explanatory variable that assigns the groups. In our case, we are testing whether the popular_or_not response variable is “independent” of the explanatory variable track_genre. 3. generate replicates After we hypothesize() the null hypothesis, we generate() replicates of “shuffled” datasets assuming the null hypothesis is true. We do this by repeating the shuffling exercise you performed in Section 9.1 several times on the full dataset of 2000 rows. Let’s use the computer to repeat this 1000 times by setting reps = 1000 in the generate() function. However, unlike for confidence intervals where we generated replicates using type = \"bootstrap\" resampling with replacement, we’ll now perform shuffles/permutations by setting type = \"permute\". Recall that shuffles/permutations are a kind of resampling, but unlike the bootstrap method, they involve resampling without replacement. spotify_generate &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) nrow(spotify_generate) [1] 2000000 Observe that the resulting data frame has 2,000,000 rows. This is because we performed shuffles/permutations for each of the 2000 rows 1000 times and \\(2,000,000 = 1000 \\cdot 2000\\). If you explore the spotify_generate data frame with View(), you’ll notice that the variable replicate indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value 1 2000 times, the value 2 2000 times, all the way through to the value 1000 2000 times. 4. calculate summary statistics Now that we have generated 1000 replicates of “shuffles” assuming the null hypothesis is true, let’s calculate() the appropriate summary statistic for each of our 1000 shuffles. From Section 9.2, point estimates related to hypothesis testing have a specific name: test statistics. Since the unknown population parameter of interest is the difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\), the test statistic here is the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{f}\\). For each of our 1000 shuffles, we can calculate this test statistic by setting stat = \"diff in props\". Furthermore, since we are interested in \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\) we set order = c(\"metal\", \"deep-house\"). As we stated earlier, the order of the subtraction does not matter, so long as you stay consistent throughout your analysis and tailor your interpretations accordingly. Let’s save the result in a data frame called null_distribution: null_distribution &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) null_distribution Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) Null Hypothesis: independence # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.0140000 2 2 -0.0420000 3 3 0.0220000 4 4 -0.0140000 5 5 -0.0180000 6 6 -0.0160000 7 7 0.0160000 8 8 -0.0400000 9 9 0.0140000 10 10 0.0120000 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that we have 1000 values of stat, each representing one instance of \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\) in a hypothesized world of no difference in genre popularity. Observe as well that we chose the name of this data frame carefully: null_distribution. Recall once again from Section 9.2 that sampling distributions when the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is assumed to be true have a special name: the null distribution. What was the observed difference in popularity rates? In other words, what was the observed test statistic \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{f}\\)? Recall from Section 9.1 that we computed this observed difference by hand to be 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4%. We can also compute this value using the previous infer code but with the hypothesize() and generate() steps removed. Let’s save this in obs_diff_prop: obs_diff_prop &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) obs_diff_prop Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0340000 Note that there is also a wrapper function in infer called observe() that can be used to calculate the observed test statistic. However, we chose to use the specify(), calculate(), and hypothesize() functions to help you continue to use the common verbs and build practice with them. spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; observe(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;, stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0340000 5. visualize the p-value The final step is to measure how surprised we are by a promotion difference of 3.4% in a hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. If the observed difference of 0.034 is highly unlikely, then we would be inclined to reject the validity of our hypothesized universe. We start by visualizing the null distribution of our 1000 values of \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\) using visualize() in Figure 9.7. Recall that these are values of the difference in popularity rates assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. This corresponds to being in our hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. visualize(null_distribution, bins = 25) FIGURE 9.7: Null distribution. Let’s now add what happened in real life to Figure 9.7, the observed difference in popularity rates of 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4%. However, instead of merely adding a vertical line using geom_vline(), let’s use the shade_p_value() function with obs_stat set to the observed test statistic value we saved in obs_diff_prop. Furthermore, we’ll set the direction = \"right\" reflecting our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\). Recall our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) is that \\(p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\), stating that there is a difference in popularity rates in favor of metal songs. “More extreme” here corresponds to differences that are “bigger” or “more positive” or “more to the right.” Hence we set the direction argument of shade_p_value() to be \"right\". On the other hand, had our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) been the other possible one-sided alternative \\(p_{m} - p_{d} &lt; 0\\), suggesting popularity in favor of deep house songs, we would’ve set direction = \"left\". Had our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) been two-sided \\(p_{m} - p_{d} \\neq 0\\), suggesting discrimination in either direction, we would’ve set direction = \"both\". visualize(null_distribution, bins = 25) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop, direction = &quot;right&quot;) FIGURE 9.8: Shaded histogram to show \\(p\\)-value. In the resulting Figure 9.8, the solid dark line marks 0.034 = 3.4%. However, what does the shaded-region correspond to? This is the \\(p\\)-value. Recall the definition of the \\(p\\)-value from Section 9.2: A \\(p\\)-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. So judging by the shaded region in Figure 9.8, it seems we would somewhat rarely observe differences in promotion rates of 0.034 = 3.4% or more in a hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. In other words, the \\(p\\)-value is somewhat small. Hence, we would be inclined to reject this hypothesized universe, or using statistical language we would “reject \\(H_0\\).” What fraction of the null distribution is shaded? In other words, what is the exact value of the \\(p\\)-value? We can compute it using the get_p_value() function with the same arguments as the previous shade_p_value() code: null_distribution |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop, direction = &quot;right&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.065 Keeping the definition of a \\(p\\)-value in mind, the probability of observing a difference in promotion rates as large as 0.034 = 3.4% due to sampling variation alone in the null distribution is 0.065 = 6.5%. Since this \\(p\\)-value is smaller than our pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1, we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\). In other words, this \\(p\\)-value is sufficiently small to reject our hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. We instead have enough evidence to change our mind in favor of difference in genre popularity being a likely culprit here. Observe that whether we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or not depends in large part on our choice of significance level \\(\\alpha\\). We’ll discuss this more in Subsection 9.4.3. 9.3.2 Comparison with confidence intervals One of the great things about the infer package is that we can jump seamlessly between conducting hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals with minimal changes! Recall the code from the previous section that creates the null distribution, which in turn is needed to compute the \\(p\\)-value: null_distribution &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) To create the corresponding bootstrap distribution needed to construct a 90% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\), we only need to make two changes. First, we remove the hypothesize() step since we are no longer assuming a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. We can do this by deleting or commenting out the hypothesize() line of code. Second, we switch the type of resampling in the generate() step to be \"bootstrap\" instead of \"permute\". bootstrap_distribution &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; # Change 1 - Remove hypothesize(): # hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; # Change 2 - Switch type from &quot;permute&quot; to &quot;bootstrap&quot;: generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) Using this bootstrap_distribution, let’s first compute the percentile-based confidence intervals, as we did in Section 8.3.2: percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distribution |&gt; get_confidence_interval(level = 0.90, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) percentile_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.000355780 0.0701690 Using our shorthand interpretation for 90% confidence intervals from Subsection ??, we are 90% “confident” that the true difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) is between (0, 0.07). Let’s visualize bootstrap_distribution and this percentile-based 90% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) in Figure 9.9. visualize(bootstrap_distribution) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci) FIGURE 9.9: Percentile-based 95% confidence interval. Notice a key value that is not included in the 95% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\): the value 0 (but just barely!). In other words, a difference of 0 is not included in our net, suggesting that \\(p_{m}\\) and \\(p_{d}\\) are truly different! Furthermore, observe how the entirety of the 95% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) lies above 0, suggesting that this difference is in favor of metal. Learning check (LC9.1) Why does the following code produce an error? In other words, what about the response and predictor variables make this not a possible computation with the infer package? library(moderndive) library(infer) null_distribution_mean &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) (LC9.2) Why are we relatively confident that the distributions of the sample proportions will be good approximations of the population distributions of popularity proportions for the two genres? (LC9.3) Using the definition of p-value, write in words what the \\(p\\)-value represents for the hypothesis test comparing the popularity rates for metal and deep house. 9.3.3 “There is only one test” Let’s recap the steps necessary to conduct a hypothesis test using the terminology, notation, and definitions related to sampling you saw in Section 9.2 and the infer workflow from Subsection 9.3.1: specify() the variables of interest in your data frame. hypothesize() the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). In other words, set a “model for the universe” assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. generate() shuffles assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. In other words, simulate data assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. calculate() the test statistic of interest, both for the observed data and your simulated data. visualize() the resulting null distribution and compute the \\(p\\)-value by comparing the null distribution to the observed test statistic. While this is a lot to digest, especially the first time you encounter hypothesis testing, the nice thing is that once you understand this general framework, then you can understand any hypothesis test. In a famous blog post, computer scientist Allen Downey called this the “There is only one test” framework, for which he created the flowchart displayed in Figure 9.10. FIGURE 9.10: Allen Downey’s hypothesis testing framework. Notice its similarity with the “hypothesis testing with infer” diagram you saw in Figure 9.6. That’s because the infer package was explicitly designed to match the “There is only one test” framework. So if you can understand the framework, you can easily generalize these ideas for all hypothesis testing scenarios. Whether for population proportions \\(p\\), population means \\(\\mu\\), differences in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\), differences in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\), and as you’ll see in Chapter 10 on inference for regression, population regression slopes \\(\\beta_1\\) as well. In fact, it applies more generally even than just these examples to more complicated hypothesis tests and test statistics as well. Learning check (LC9.4) Describe in a paragraph how we used Allen Downey’s diagram to conclude if a statistical difference existed between the popularity rate of metal and deep house for the Spotify example. 9.4 Interpreting hypothesis tests Interpreting the results of hypothesis tests is one of the more challenging aspects of this method for statistical inference. In this section, we’ll focus on ways to help with deciphering the process and address some common misconceptions. 9.4.1 Two possible outcomes In Section 9.2, we mentioned that given a pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) there are two possible outcomes of a hypothesis test: If the \\(p\\)-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\), then we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\). If the \\(p\\)-value is greater than or equal to \\(\\alpha\\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). Unfortunately, the latter result is often misinterpreted as “accepting the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).” While at first glance it may seem that the statements “failing to reject \\(H_0\\)” and “accepting \\(H_0\\)” are equivalent, there actually is a subtle difference. Saying that we “accept the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\)” is equivalent to stating that “we think the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true.” However, saying that we “fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\)” is saying something else: “While \\(H_0\\) might still be false, we don’t have enough evidence to say so.” In other words, there is an absence of enough proof. However, the absence of proof is not proof of absence. To further shed light on this distinction, let’s use the United States criminal justice system as an analogy. A criminal trial in the United States is a similar situation to hypothesis tests whereby a choice between two contradictory claims must be made about a defendant who is on trial: The defendant is truly either “innocent” or “guilty.” The defendant is presumed “innocent until proven guilty.” The defendant is found guilty only if there is strong evidence that the defendant is guilty. The phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” is often used as a guideline for determining a cutoff for when enough evidence exists to find the defendant guilty. The defendant is found to be either “not guilty” or “guilty” in the ultimate verdict. In other words, not guilty verdicts are not suggesting the defendant is innocent, but instead that “while the defendant may still actually be guilty, there wasn’t enough evidence to prove this fact.” Now let’s make the connection with hypothesis tests: Either the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) is true. Hypothesis tests are conducted assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. We reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\) only if the evidence found in the sample suggests that \\(H_A\\) is true. The significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is used as a guideline to set the threshold on just how strong of evidence we require. We ultimately decide to either “fail to reject \\(H_0\\)” or “reject \\(H_0\\).” So while gut instinct may suggest “failing to reject \\(H_0\\)” and “accepting \\(H_0\\)” are equivalent statements, they are not. “Accepting \\(H_0\\)” is equivalent to finding a defendant innocent. However, courts do not find defendants “innocent,” but rather they find them “not guilty.” Putting things differently, defense attorneys do not need to prove that their clients are innocent, rather they only need to prove that clients are not “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt”. So going back to our songs activity in Section 9.3, recall that our hypothesis test was \\(H_0: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\) and that we used a pre-specified significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1. We found a \\(p\\)-value of 0.065. Since the \\(p\\)-value was smaller than \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1, we rejected \\(H_0\\). In other words, we found needed levels of evidence in this particular sample to say that \\(H_0\\) is false at the \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1 significance level. We also state this conclusion using non-statistical language: we found enough evidence in this data to suggest that there was gender discrimination at play. 9.4.2 Types of errors Unfortunately, there is some chance a jury or a judge can make an incorrect decision in a criminal trial by reaching the wrong verdict. For example, finding a truly innocent defendant “guilty”. Or on the other hand, finding a truly guilty defendant “not guilty.” This can often stem from the fact that prosecutors don’t have access to all the relevant evidence, but instead are limited to whatever evidence the police can find. The same holds for hypothesis tests. We can make incorrect decisions about a population parameter because we only have a sample of data from the population and thus sampling variation can lead us to incorrect conclusions. There are two possible erroneous conclusions in a criminal trial: either (1) a truly innocent person is found guilty or (2) a truly guilty person is found not guilty. Similarly, there are two possible errors in a hypothesis test: either (1) rejecting \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is true, called a Type I error or (2) failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is false, called a Type II error. Another term used for “Type I error” is “false positive,” while another term for “Type II error” is “false negative.” This risk of error is the price researchers pay for basing inference on a sample instead of performing a census on the entire population. But as we’ve seen in our numerous examples and activities so far, censuses are often very expensive and other times impossible, and thus researchers have no choice but to use a sample. Thus in any hypothesis test based on a sample, we have no choice but to tolerate some chance that a Type I error will be made and some chance that a Type II error will occur. To help understand the concepts of Type I error and Type II errors, we apply these terms to our criminal justice analogy in Figure 9.11. FIGURE 9.11: Type I and Type II errors in criminal trials. Thus a Type I error corresponds to incorrectly putting a truly innocent person in jail, whereas a Type II error corresponds to letting a truly guilty person go free. Let’s show the corresponding table in Figure 9.12 for hypothesis tests. FIGURE 9.12: Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis tests. 9.4.3 How do we choose alpha? If we are using a sample to make inferences about a population, we run the risk of making errors. For confidence intervals, a corresponding “error” would be constructing a confidence interval that does not contain the true value of the population parameter. For hypothesis tests, this would be making either a Type I or Type II error. Obviously, we want to minimize the probability of either error; we want a small probability of making an incorrect conclusion: The probability of a Type I Error occurring is denoted by \\(\\alpha\\). The value of \\(\\alpha\\) is called the significance level of the hypothesis test, which we defined in Section 9.2. The probability of a Type II Error is denoted by \\(\\beta\\). The value of \\(1-\\beta\\) is known as the power of the hypothesis test. In other words, \\(\\alpha\\) corresponds to the probability of incorrectly rejecting \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is true. On the other hand, \\(\\beta\\) corresponds to the probability of incorrectly failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is false. Ideally, we want \\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0\\), meaning that the chance of making either error is 0. However, this can never be the case in any situation where we are sampling for inference. There will always be the possibility of making either error when we use sample data. Furthermore, these two error probabilities are inversely related. As the probability of a Type I error goes down, the probability of a Type II error goes up. What is typically done in practice is to fix the probability of a Type I error by pre-specifying a significance level \\(\\alpha\\) and then try to minimize \\(\\beta\\). In other words, we will tolerate a certain fraction of incorrect rejections of the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), and then try to minimize the fraction of incorrect non-rejections of \\(H_0\\). So for example if we used \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.01, we would be using a hypothesis testing procedure that in the long run would incorrectly reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) one percent of the time. This is analogous to setting the confidence level of a confidence interval. So what value should you use for \\(\\alpha\\)? Different fields have different conventions, but some commonly used values include 0.10, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. However, it is important to keep in mind that if you use a relatively small value of \\(\\alpha\\), then all things being equal, \\(p\\)-values will have a harder time being less than \\(\\alpha\\). Thus, we would reject the null hypothesis less often. In other words, we would reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) only if we have very strong evidence to do so. This is known as a “conservative” test. On the other hand, if we used a relatively large value of \\(\\alpha\\), then all things being equal, \\(p\\)-values will have an easier time being less than \\(\\alpha\\). Thus we would reject the null hypothesis more often. In other words, we would reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) even if we only have mild evidence to do so. This is known as a “liberal” test. Learning check (LC9.5) What is wrong about saying, “The defendant is innocent.” based on the US system of criminal trials? (LC9.6) What is the purpose of hypothesis testing? (LC9.7) What are some flaws with hypothesis testing? How could we alleviate them? (LC9.8) Consider two \\(\\alpha\\) significance levels of 0.1 and 0.01. Of the two, which would lead to a more liberal hypothesis testing procedure? In other words, one that will, all things being equal, lead to more rejections of the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). 9.5 Case study: Are action or romance movies rated higher? Let’s apply our knowledge of hypothesis testing to answer the question: “Are action or romance movies rated higher on IMDb?”. IMDb is a database on the internet providing information on movie and television show casts, plot summaries, trivia, and ratings. We’ll investigate if, on average, action or romance movies get higher ratings on IMDb. 9.5.1 IMDb ratings data The movies dataset in the ggplot2movies package contains information on 58,788 movies that have been rated by users of IMDb.com. movies # A tibble: 58,788 × 24 title year length budget rating votes r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 $ 1971 121 NA 6.4 348 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 24.5 2 $1000 a… 1939 71 NA 6 20 0 14.5 4.5 24.5 14.5 14.5 3 $21 a D… 1941 7 NA 8.2 5 0 0 0 0 0 24.5 4 $40,000 1996 70 NA 8.2 6 14.5 0 0 0 0 0 5 $50,000… 1975 71 NA 3.4 17 24.5 4.5 0 14.5 14.5 4.5 6 $pent 2000 91 NA 4.3 45 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 14.5 14.5 7 $windle 2002 93 NA 5.3 200 4.5 0 4.5 4.5 24.5 24.5 8 &#39;15&#39; 2002 25 NA 6.7 24 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 9 &#39;38 1987 97 NA 6.6 18 4.5 4.5 4.5 0 0 0 10 &#39;49-&#39;17 1917 61 NA 6 51 4.5 0 4.5 4.5 4.5 44.5 # ℹ 58,778 more rows # ℹ 12 more variables: r7 &lt;dbl&gt;, r8 &lt;dbl&gt;, r9 &lt;dbl&gt;, r10 &lt;dbl&gt;, mpaa &lt;chr&gt;, # Action &lt;int&gt;, Animation &lt;int&gt;, Comedy &lt;int&gt;, Drama &lt;int&gt;, # Documentary &lt;int&gt;, Romance &lt;int&gt;, Short &lt;int&gt; We’ll focus on a random sample of 68 movies that are classified as either “action” or “romance” movies but not both. We disregard movies that are classified as both so that we can assign all 68 movies into either category. Furthermore, since the original movies dataset was a little messy, we provide a pre-wrangled version of our data in the movies_sample data frame included in the moderndive package. If you’re curious, you can look at the necessary data wrangling code to do this on GitHub. movies_sample # A tibble: 68 × 4 title year rating genre &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Underworld 1985 3.1 Action 2 Love Affair 1932 6.3 Romance 3 Junglee 1961 6.8 Romance 4 Eversmile, New Jersey 1989 5 Romance 5 Search and Destroy 1979 4 Action 6 Secreto de Romelia, El 1988 4.9 Romance 7 Amants du Pont-Neuf, Les 1991 7.4 Romance 8 Illicit Dreams 1995 3.5 Action 9 Kabhi Kabhie 1976 7.7 Romance 10 Electric Horseman, The 1979 5.8 Romance # ℹ 58 more rows The variables include the title and year the movie was filmed. Furthermore, we have a numerical variable rating, which is the IMDb rating out of 10 stars, and a binary categorical variable genre indicating if the movie was an Action or Romance movie. We are interested in whether Action or Romance movies got a higher rating on average. Let’s perform an exploratory data analysis of this data. Recall from Subsection 2.7.1 that a boxplot is a visualization we can use to show the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable. Another option you saw in Section 2.6 would be to use a faceted histogram. However, in the interest of brevity, let’s only present the boxplot in Figure 9.13. ggplot(data = movies_sample, aes(x = genre, y = rating)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(y = &quot;IMDb rating&quot;) FIGURE 9.13: Boxplot of IMDb rating vs. genre. Eyeballing Figure 9.13, romance movies have a higher median rating. Do we have reason to believe, however, that there is a significant difference between the mean rating for action movies compared to romance movies? It’s hard to say just based on this plot. The boxplot does show that the median sample rating is higher for romance movies. However, there is a large amount of overlap between the boxes. Recall that the median isn’t necessarily the same as the mean either, depending on whether the distribution is skewed. Let’s calculate some summary statistics split by the binary categorical variable genre: the number of movies, the mean rating, and the standard deviation split by genre. We’ll do this using dplyr data wrangling verbs. Notice in particular how we count the number of each type of movie using the n() summary function. movies_sample |&gt; group_by(genre) |&gt; summarize(n = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating), std_dev = sd(rating)) # A tibble: 2 × 4 genre n mean_rating std_dev &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Action 32 5.275 1.36121 2 Romance 36 6.32222 1.60963 Observe that we have 36 movies with an average rating of 6.322 stars and 32 movies with an average rating of 5.275 stars. The difference in these average ratings is thus 6.322 - 5.275 = 1.047. So there appears to be an edge of 1.047 stars in favor of romance movies. The question is, however, are these results indicative of a true difference for all romance and action movies? Or could we attribute this difference to chance sampling variation? 9.5.2 Sampling scenario Let’s now revisit this study in terms of terminology and notation related to sampling we studied in Subsection 7.2.1. The study population is all movies in the IMDb database that are either action or romance (but not both). The sample from this population is the 68 movies included in the movies_sample dataset. Since this sample was randomly taken from the population movies, it is representative of all romance and action movies on IMDb. Thus, any analysis and results based on movies_sample can generalize to the entire population. What are the relevant population parameter and point estimates? We introduce the fourth sampling scenario in Table 9.2. TABLE 9.2: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}_1 - \\widehat{\\mu}_2\\) So, whereas the sampling bowl exercise in Section 7.1 concerned proportions, the pennies exercise in Section ?? concerned means, the case study on whether yawning is contagious in Section 8.5 and the promotions activity in Section 9.1 concerned differences in proportions, we are now concerned with differences in means. In other words, the population parameter of interest is the difference in population mean ratings \\(\\mu_a - \\mu_r\\), where \\(\\mu_a\\) is the mean rating of all action movies on IMDb and similarly \\(\\mu_r\\) is the mean rating of all romance movies. Additionally the point estimate/sample statistic of interest is the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\), where \\(\\overline{x}_a\\) is the mean rating of the \\(n_a\\) = 32 movies in our sample and \\(\\overline{x}_r\\) is the mean rating of the \\(n_r\\) = 36 in our sample. Based on our earlier exploratory data analysis, our estimate \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\) is \\(5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047\\). So there appears to be a slight difference of -1.047 in favor of romance movies. The question is, however, could this difference of -1.047 be merely due to chance and sampling variation? Or are these results indicative of a true difference in mean ratings for all romance and action movies on IMDb? To answer this question, we’ll use hypothesis testing. 9.5.3 Conducting the hypothesis test We’ll be testing: \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: \\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A&amp;: \\mu_a - \\mu_r \\neq 0 \\end{aligned} \\] In other words, the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) suggests that both romance and action movies have the same mean rating. This is the “hypothesized universe” we’ll assume is true. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) suggests that there is a difference. Unlike the one-sided alternative we used in the promotions exercise \\(H_A: p_m - p_f &gt; 0\\), we are now considering a two-sided alternative of \\(H_A: \\mu_a - \\mu_r \\neq 0\\). Furthermore, we’ll pre-specify a low significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.001. By setting this value low, all things being equal, there is a lower chance that the \\(p\\)-value will be less than \\(\\alpha\\). Thus, there is a lower chance that we’ll reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\). In other words, we’ll reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in mean ratings for all action and romance movies, only if we have quite strong evidence. This is known as a “conservative” hypothesis testing procedure. 1. specify variables Let’s now perform all the steps of the infer workflow. We first specify() the variables of interest in the movies_sample data frame using the formula rating ~ genre. This tells infer that the numerical variable rating is the outcome variable, while the binary variable genre is the explanatory variable. Note that unlike previously when we were interested in proportions, since we are now interested in the mean of a numerical variable, we do not need to set the success argument. movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) Response: rating (numeric) Explanatory: genre (factor) # A tibble: 68 × 2 rating genre &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 3.1 Action 2 6.3 Romance 3 6.8 Romance 4 5 Romance 5 4 Action 6 4.9 Romance 7 7.4 Romance 8 3.5 Action 9 7.7 Romance 10 5.8 Romance # ℹ 58 more rows Observe at this point that the data in movies_sample has not changed. The only change so far is the newly defined Response: rating (numeric) and Explanatory: genre (factor) meta-data. 2. hypothesize the null We set the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\) by using the hypothesize() function. Since we have two samples, action and romance movies, we set null to be \"independence\" as we described in Section 9.3. movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) Response: rating (numeric) Explanatory: genre (factor) Null Hypothesis: independence # A tibble: 68 × 2 rating genre &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 3.1 Action 2 6.3 Romance 3 6.8 Romance 4 5 Romance 5 4 Action 6 4.9 Romance 7 7.4 Romance 8 3.5 Action 9 7.7 Romance 10 5.8 Romance # ℹ 58 more rows 3. generate replicates After we have set the null hypothesis, we generate “shuffled” replicates assuming the null hypothesis is true by repeating the shuffling/permutation exercise you performed in Section 9.1. We’ll repeat this resampling without replacement of type = \"permute\" a total of reps = 1000 times. Feel free to run the code below to check out what the generate() step produces. movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; View() 4. calculate summary statistics Now that we have 1000 replicated “shuffles” assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) that both Action and Romance movies on average have the same ratings on IMDb, let’s calculate() the appropriate summary statistic for these 1000 replicated shuffles. From Section 9.2, summary statistics relating to hypothesis testing have a specific name: test statistics. Since the unknown population parameter of interest is the difference in population means \\(\\mu_{a} - \\mu_{r}\\), the test statistic of interest here is the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\). For each of our 1000 shuffles, we can calculate this test statistic by setting stat = \"diff in means\". Furthermore, since we are interested in \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\), we set order = c(\"Action\", \"Romance\"). Let’s save the results in a data frame called null_distribution_movies: null_distribution_movies &lt;- movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;)) null_distribution_movies # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.511111 2 2 0.345833 3 3 -0.327083 4 4 -0.209028 5 5 -0.433333 6 6 -0.102778 7 7 0.387153 8 8 0.168750 9 9 0.257292 10 10 0.334028 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that we have 1000 values of stat, each representing one instance of \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\). The 1000 values form the null distribution, which is the technical term for the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\) assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. What happened in real life? What was the observed difference in promotion rates? What was the observed test statistic \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\)? Recall from our earlier data wrangling, this observed difference in means was \\(5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047\\). We can also achieve this using the code that constructed the null distribution null_distribution_movies but with the hypothesize() and generate() steps removed. Let’s save this in obs_diff_means: obs_diff_means &lt;- movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;)) obs_diff_means Response: rating (numeric) Explanatory: genre (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -1.04722 5. visualize the p-value Lastly, in order to compute the \\(p\\)-value, we have to assess how “extreme” the observed difference in means of -1.047 is. We do this by comparing -1.047 to our null distribution, which was constructed in a hypothesized universe of no true difference in movie ratings. Let’s visualize both the null distribution and the \\(p\\)-value in Figure 9.14. Unlike our example in Subsection 9.3.1 involving promotions, since we have a two-sided \\(H_A: \\mu_a - \\mu_r \\neq 0\\), we have to allow for both possibilities for more extreme, so we set direction = \"both\". visualize(null_distribution_movies, bins = 10) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_means, direction = &quot;both&quot;) FIGURE 9.14: Null distribution, observed test statistic, and \\(p\\)-value. Let’s go over the elements of this plot. First, the histogram is the null distribution. Second, the solid line is the observed test statistic, or the difference in sample means we observed in real life of \\(5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047\\). Third, the two shaded areas of the histogram form the \\(p\\)-value, or the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. What proportion of the null distribution is shaded? In other words, what is the numerical value of the \\(p\\)-value? We use the get_p_value() function to compute this value: null_distribution_movies |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_means, direction = &quot;both&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.004 This \\(p\\)-value of 0.004 is very small. In other words, there is a very small chance that we’d observe a difference of 5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047 in a hypothesized universe where there was truly no difference in ratings. But this \\(p\\)-value is larger than our (even smaller) pre-specified \\(\\alpha\\) significance level of 0.001. Thus, we are inclined to fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\). In non-statistical language, the conclusion is: we do not have the evidence needed in this sample of data to suggest that we should reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in mean IMDb ratings between romance and action movies. We, thus, cannot say that a difference exists in romance and action movie ratings, on average, for all IMDb movies. Learning check (LC9.9) Conduct the same analysis comparing action movies versus romantic movies using the median rating instead of the mean rating. What was different and what was the same? (LC9.10) What conclusions can you make from viewing the faceted histogram looking at rating versus genre that you couldn’t see when looking at the boxplot? (LC9.11) Describe in a paragraph how we used Allen Downey’s diagram to conclude if a statistical difference existed between mean movie ratings for action and romance movies. (LC9.12) Why are we relatively confident that the distributions of the sample ratings will be good approximations of the population distributions of ratings for the two genres? (LC9.13) Using the definition of \\(p\\)-value, write in words what the \\(p\\)-value represents for the hypothesis test comparing the mean rating of romance to action movies. (LC9.14) What is the value of the \\(p\\)-value for the hypothesis test comparing the mean rating of romance to action movies? (LC9.15) Test your data wrangling knowledge and EDA skills: Use dplyr and tidyr to create the necessary data frame focused on only action and romance movies (but not both) from the movies data frame in the ggplot2movies package. Make a boxplot and a faceted histogram of this population data comparing ratings of action and romance movies from IMDb. Discuss how these plots compare to the similar plots produced for the movies_sample data. 9.6 Conclusion 9.6.1 Theory-based hypothesis tests Much as we did in Subsections ?? and ?? when we showed you theory-based methods for compututing standard errors and constructing confidence intervals that involved mathematical formulas, we now present an example of a traditional theory-based method to conduct hypothesis tests. This method relies on probability models, probability distributions, and a few assumptions to construct the null distribution. This is in contrast to the approach we’ve been using throughout this book where we relied on computer simulations to construct the null distribution. These traditional theory-based methods have been used for decades mostly because researchers didn’t have access to computers that could run thousands of calculations quickly and efficiently. Now that computing power is much cheaper and more accessible, simulation-based methods are much more feasible. However, researchers in many fields continue to use theory-based methods. Hence, we make it a point to include an example here. As we’ll show in this section, any theory-based method is ultimately an approximation to the simulation-based method. The theory-based method we’ll focus on is known as the two-sample \\(t\\)-test for testing differences in sample means. However, the test statistic we’ll use won’t be the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\), but rather the related two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic. The data we’ll use will once again be the movies_sample data of action and romance movies from Section 9.5. Two-sample t-statistic A common task in statistics is the process of “standardizing a variable.” By standardizing different variables, we make them more comparable. For example, say you are interested in studying the distribution of temperature recordings from Phoenix, Arizona, USA and comparing it to that of the temperature recordings in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Given that US temperatures are generally recorded in degrees Fahrenheit and Canadian temperatures are generally recorded in degrees Celsius, how can we make them comparable? One approach would be to convert degrees Fahrenheit into Celsius, or vice versa. Another approach would be to convert them both to a common “standardized” scale, like Kelvin units of temperature. One common method for standardizing a variable from probability and statistics theory is to compute the \\(z\\)-score: \\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\] where \\(x\\) represents one value of a variable, \\(\\mu\\) represents the mean of that variable, and \\(\\sigma\\) represents the standard deviation of that variable. You first subtract the mean \\(\\mu\\) from each value of \\(x\\) and then divide \\(x - \\mu\\) by the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). These operations will have the effect of re-centering your variable around 0 and re-scaling your variable \\(x\\) so that they have what are known as “standard units.” Thus for every value that your variable can take, it has a corresponding \\(z\\)-score that gives how many standard units away that value is from the mean \\(\\mu\\). \\(z\\)-scores are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This curve is called a “\\(z\\)-distribution” or “standard normal” curve and has the common, bell-shaped pattern from Figure 9.15 discussed in Appendix A.2. FIGURE 9.15: Standard normal z curve. Bringing these back to the difference of sample mean ratings \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\) of action versus romance movies, how would we standardize this variable? By once again subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. Recall two facts from Subsection ??. First, if the sampling was done in a representative fashion, then the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\) will be centered at the true population parameter \\(\\mu_a - \\mu_r\\). Second, the standard deviation of point estimates like \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\) has a special name: the standard error. Applying these ideas, we present the two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic: \\[t = \\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r) - (\\mu_a - \\mu_r)}{ \\text{SE}_{\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r} } = \\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r) - (\\mu_a - \\mu_r)}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} }\\] Oofda! There is a lot to try to unpack here! Let’s go slowly. In the numerator, \\(\\bar{x}_a-\\bar{x}_r\\) is the difference in sample means, while \\(\\mu_a - \\mu_r\\) is the difference in population means. In the denominator, \\(s_a\\) and \\(s_r\\) are the sample standard deviations of the action and romance movies in our sample movies_sample. Lastly, \\(n_a\\) and \\(n_r\\) are the sample sizes of the action and romance movies. Putting this together under the square root gives us the standard error \\(\\text{SE}_{\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r}\\). Observe that the formula for \\(\\text{SE}_{\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r}\\) has the sample sizes \\(n_a\\) and \\(n_r\\) in them. So as the sample sizes increase, the standard error goes down. We’ve seen this concept numerous times now, in particular (1) in our simulations using the three virtual shovels with \\(n\\) = 25, 50, and 100 slots in Figure 7.13, (2) in Subsection 8.2.5.1 where we studied the effect of using larger sample sizes on the widths of confidence intervals, and (3) in Subsection ?? where we studied the formula-based approximation to the standard error of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\). So how can we use the two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic as a test statistic in our hypothesis test? First, assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\) is true, the right-hand side of the numerator (to the right of the \\(-\\) sign), \\(\\mu_a - \\mu_r\\), becomes 0. Second, similarly to how the Central Limit Theorem from Subsection ?? states that sample means follow a normal distribution, it can be mathematically proven that the two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom “roughly equal” to \\(df = n_a + n_r - 2\\). To better understand this concept of degrees of freedom, we next display three examples of \\(t\\)-distributions in Figure 9.16 along with the standard normal \\(z\\) curve. FIGURE 9.16: Examples of t-distributions and the z curve. Begin by looking at the center of the plot at 0 on the horizontal axis. As you move up from the value of 0, follow along with the labels and note that the bottom curve corresponds to 1 degree of freedom, the curve above it is for 3 degrees of freedom, the curve above that is for 10 degrees of freedom, and lastly the dotted curve is the standard normal \\(z\\) curve. Observe that all four curves have a bell shape, are centered at 0, and that as the degrees of freedom increase, the \\(t\\)-distribution more and more resembles the standard normal \\(z\\) curve. The “degrees of freedom” measures how different the \\(t\\) distribution will be from a normal distribution. \\(t\\)-distributions tend to have more values in the tails of their distributions than the standard normal \\(z\\) curve. This “roughly equal” statement indicates that the equation \\(df = n_a + n_r - 2\\) is a “good enough” approximation to the true degrees of freedom. The true formula is a bit more complicated than this simple expression, but we’ve found the formula to be beyond the reach of those new to statistical inference and it does little to build the intuition of the \\(t\\)-test. The message to retain, however, is that small sample sizes lead to small degrees of freedom and thus small sample sizes lead to \\(t\\)-distributions that are different than the \\(z\\) curve. On the other hand, large sample sizes correspond to large degrees of freedom and thus produce \\(t\\) distributions that closely align with the standard normal \\(z\\)-curve. So, assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true, our formula for the test statistic simplifies a bit: \\[t = \\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r) - 0}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} } = \\dfrac{ \\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} }\\] Let’s compute the values necessary for this two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic. Recall the summary statistics we computed during our exploratory data analysis in Section 9.5.1. movies_sample |&gt; group_by(genre) |&gt; summarize(n = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating), std_dev = sd(rating)) # A tibble: 2 × 4 genre n mean_rating std_dev &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Action 32 5.275 1.36121 2 Romance 36 6.32222 1.60963 Using these values, the observed two-sample \\(t\\)-test statistic is \\[ \\dfrac{ \\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} } = \\dfrac{5.28 - 6.32}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{1.36}^2}{32} + \\dfrac{{1.61}^2}{36}} } = -2.906 \\] Great! How can we compute the \\(p\\)-value using this theory-based test statistic? We need to compare it to a null distribution, which we construct next. Null distribution Let’s revisit the null distribution for the test statistic \\(\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r\\) we constructed in Section 9.5. Let’s visualize this in the left-hand plot of Figure 9.17. # Construct null distribution of xbar_a - xbar_r: null_distribution_movies &lt;- movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;)) visualize(null_distribution_movies, bins = 10) The infer package also includes some built-in theory-based test statistics as well. So instead of calculating the test statistic of interest as the \"diff in means\" \\(\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r\\), we can calculate this defined two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic by setting stat = \"t\". Let’s visualize this in the right-hand plot of Figure 9.17. # Construct null distribution of t: null_distribution_movies_t &lt;- movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; # Notice we switched stat from &quot;diff in means&quot; to &quot;t&quot; calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;)) visualize(null_distribution_movies_t, bins = 10) FIGURE 9.17: Comparing the null distributions of two test statistics. Observe that while the shape of the null distributions of both the difference in means \\(\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r\\) and the two-sample \\(t\\)-statistics are similar, the scales on the x-axis are different. The two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic values are spread out over a larger range. However, a traditional theory-based \\(t\\)-test doesn’t look at the simulated histogram in null_distribution_movies_t, but instead it looks at the \\(t\\)-distribution curve with degrees of freedom equal to roughly 65.85. This calculation is based on the complicated formula referenced previously, which we approximated with \\(df = n_a + n_r - 2 = 32 + 36 - 2 = 66\\). Let’s overlay this \\(t\\)-distribution curve over the top of our simulated two-sample \\(t\\)-statistics using the method = \"both\" argument in visualize(). visualize(null_distribution_movies_t, bins = 10, method = &quot;both&quot;) FIGURE 9.18: Null distribution using t-statistic and t-distribution. Observe that the curve does a good job of approximating the histogram here. To calculate the \\(p\\)-value in this case, we need to figure out how much of the total area under the \\(t\\)-distribution curve is at or “more extreme” than our observed two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic. Since \\(H_A: \\mu_a - \\mu_r \\neq 0\\) is a two-sided alternative, we need to add up the areas in both tails. We first compute the observed two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic using infer verbs. This shortcut calculation further assumes that the null hypothesis is true: that the population of action and romance movies have an equal average rating. obs_two_sample_t &lt;- movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;)) obs_two_sample_t Response: rating (numeric) Explanatory: genre (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -2.90589 We want to find the percentage of values that are at or below obs_two_sample_t \\(= -2.906\\) or at or above -obs_two_sample_t \\(= 2.906\\). We use the shade_p_value() function with the direction argument set to \"both\" to do this: visualize(null_distribution_movies_t, method = &quot;both&quot;) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_two_sample_t, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Warning: Check to make sure the conditions have been met for the theoretical method. infer currently does not check these for you. FIGURE 9.19: Null distribution using t-statistic and t-distribution with \\(p\\)-value shaded. (We’ll discuss this warning message shortly.) What is the \\(p\\)-value? We apply get_p_value() to our null distribution saved in null_distribution_movies_t: null_distribution_movies_t |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_two_sample_t, direction = &quot;both&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.002 We have a very small \\(p\\)-value, and thus it is very unlikely that these results are due to sampling variation. Thus, we are inclined to reject \\(H_0\\). Let’s come back to that earlier warning message: Check to make sure the conditions have been met for the theoretical method. {infer} currently does not check these for you. To be able to use the \\(t\\)-test and other such theoretical methods, there are always a few conditions to check. The infer package does not automatically check these conditions, hence the warning message we received. These conditions are necessary so that the underlying mathematical theory holds. In order for the results of our two-sample \\(t\\)-test to be valid, three conditions must be met: Nearly normal populations or large sample sizes. A general rule of thumb that works in many (but not all) situations is that the sample size \\(n\\) should be greater than 30. Both samples are selected independently of each other. All observations are independent from each other. Let’s see if these conditions hold for our movies_sample data: This is met since \\(n_a\\) = 32 and \\(n_r\\) = 36 are both larger than 30, satisfying our rule of thumb. This is met since we sampled the action and romance movies at random and in an unbiased fashion from the database of all IMDb movies. Unfortunately, we don’t know how IMDb computes the ratings. For example, if the same person rated multiple movies, then those observations would be related and hence not independent. Assuming all three conditions are roughly met, we can be reasonably certain that the theory-based \\(t\\)-test results are valid. If any of the conditions were clearly not met, we couldn’t put as much trust into any conclusions reached. On the other hand, in most scenarios, the only assumption that needs to be met in the simulation-based method is that the sample is selected at random. Thus, in our experience, we prefer simulation-based methods as they have fewer assumptions, are conceptually easier to understand, and since computing power has recently become easily accessible, they can be run quickly. That being said since much of the world’s research still relies on traditional theory-based methods, we also believe it is important to understand them. You may be wondering why we chose reps = 1000 for these simulation-based methods. We’ve noticed that after around 1000 replicates for the null distribution and the bootstrap distribution for most problems you can start to get a general sense for how the statistic behaves. You can change this value to something like 10,000 though for reps if you would like even finer detail but this will take more time to compute. Feel free to iterate on this as you like to get an even better idea about the shape of the null and bootstrap distributions as you wish. 9.6.2 When inference is not needed We’ve now walked through several different examples of how to use the infer package to perform statistical inference: constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests. For each of these examples, we made it a point to always perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) first; specifically, by looking at the raw data values, by using data visualization with ggplot2, and by data wrangling with dplyr beforehand. We highly encourage you to always do the same. As a beginner to statistics, EDA helps you develop intuition as to what statistical methods like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests can tell us. Even as a seasoned practitioner of statistics, EDA helps guide your statistical investigations. In particular, is statistical inference even needed? Let’s consider an example. Say we’re interested in the following question: Of all flights leaving a New York City airport, are Hawaiian Airlines flights in the air for longer than Alaska Airlines flights? Furthermore, let’s assume that 2023 flights are a representative sample of all such flights. Then we can use the flights data frame in the nycflights23 package we introduced in Section 1.4 to answer our question. Let’s filter this data frame to only include Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines using their carrier codes HA and AS: flights_sample &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(carrier %in% c(&quot;HA&quot;, &quot;AS&quot;)) There are two possible statistical inference methods we could use to answer such questions. First, we could construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means \\(\\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS}\\), where \\(\\mu_{HA}\\) is the mean air time of all Hawaiian Airlines flights and \\(\\mu_{AS}\\) is the mean air time of all Alaska Airlines flights. We could then check if the entirety of the interval is greater than 0, suggesting that \\(\\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS} &gt; 0\\), or, in other words suggesting that \\(\\mu_{HA} &gt; \\mu_{AS}\\). Second, we could perform a hypothesis test of the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS} = 0\\) versus the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS} &gt; 0\\). However, let’s first construct an exploratory visualization as we suggested earlier. Since air_time is numerical and carrier is categorical, a boxplot can display the relationship between these two variables, which we display in Figure 9.20. ggplot(data = flights_sample, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = air_time)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Carrier&quot;, y = &quot;Air Time&quot;) FIGURE 9.20: Air time for Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines flights departing NYC in 2023. This is what we like to call “no PhD in Statistics needed” moments. You don’t have to be an expert in statistics to know that Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have significantly different air times. The two boxplots don’t even overlap! Constructing a confidence interval or conducting a hypothesis test would frankly not provide much more insight than Figure 9.20. Let’s investigate why we observe such a clear cut difference between these two airlines using data wrangling. Let’s first group by the rows of flights_sample not only by carrier but also by destination dest. Subsequently, we’ll compute two summary statistics: the number of observations using n() and the mean airtime: flights_sample |&gt; group_by(carrier, dest) |&gt; summarize(n = n(), mean_time = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)) `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;carrier&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. # A tibble: 8 × 4 # Groups: carrier [2] carrier dest n mean_time &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 AS LAS 1 299 2 AS LAX 980 323.929 3 AS PDX 710 326.383 4 AS PSP 18 309.611 5 AS SAN 1034 325.457 6 AS SEA 2417 324.787 7 AS SFO 2683 343.542 8 HA HNL 366 623.287 It turns out that from New York City in 2023, Alaska flew to seven different airports on the West Coast region of the US while Hawaiian only flew to HNL (Honolulu) from NYC. Given the clear difference in distance from New York City to the West Coast versus New York City to Honolulu, it is not surprising that we observe such different (statistically significantly different, in fact) air times in flights. This is a clear example of not needing to do anything more than a simple exploratory data analysis using data visualization and descriptive statistics to get an appropriate conclusion. This is why we highly recommend you perform an EDA of any sample data before running statistical inference methods like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. 9.6.3 Problems with p-values On top of the many common misunderstandings about hypothesis testing and \\(p\\)-values we listed in Section 9.4, another unfortunate consequence of the expanded use of \\(p\\)-values and hypothesis testing is a phenomenon known as “p-hacking.” p-hacking is the act of “cherry-picking” only results that are “statistically significant” while dismissing those that aren’t, even if at the expense of the scientific ideas. There are lots of articles written recently about misunderstandings and the problems with \\(p\\)-values. We encourage you to check some of them out: Misuse of \\(p\\)-values What a nerdy debate about \\(p\\)-values shows about science - and how to fix it Statisticians issue warning over misuse of \\(P\\) values You Can’t Trust What You Read About Nutrition A Litany of Problems with p-values Such issues were getting so problematic that the American Statistical Association (ASA) put out a statement in 2016 titled, “The ASA Statement on Statistical Significance and \\(P\\)-Values,” with six principles underlying the proper use and interpretation of \\(p\\)-values. The ASA released this guidance on \\(p\\)-values to improve the conduct and interpretation of quantitative science and to inform the growing emphasis on reproducibility of science research. We as authors much prefer the use of confidence intervals for statistical inference, since in our opinion they are much less prone to large misinterpretation. However, many fields still exclusively use \\(p\\)-values for statistical inference and this is one reason for including them in this text. We encourage you to learn more about “p-hacking” as well and its implication for science. 9.6.4 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. If you want more examples of the infer workflow for conducting hypothesis tests, we suggest you check out the infer package homepage, in particular, a series of example analyses available at https://infer.netlify.app/articles/. 9.6.5 What’s to come We conclude with the infer pipeline for hypothesis testing in Figure 9.21. FIGURE 9.21: infer package workflow for hypothesis testing. Now that we’ve armed ourselves with an understanding of confidence intervals from Chapter 8 and hypothesis tests from this chapter, we’ll now study inference for regression in the upcoming Chapter 10. "],["10-inference-for-regression.html", "Chapter 10 Inference for Regression 10.1 Regression refresher 10.2 Interpreting regression tables 10.3 Conditions for inference for regression 10.4 Simulation-based inference for regression 10.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 10 Inference for Regression In our penultimate chapter, we’ll revisit the regression models we first studied in Chapters 5 and 6. Armed with our knowledge of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests from Chapters 8 and 9, we’ll be able to apply statistical inference to further our understanding of relationships between outcome and explanatory variables. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Recall from our discussion in Section 4.4 that loading the tidyverse package by running library(tidyverse) loads the following commonly used data science packages all at once: ggplot2 for data visualization dplyr for data wrangling tidyr for converting data to “tidy” format readr for importing spreadsheet data into R As well as the more advanced purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats packages If needed, read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(infer) 10.1 Regression refresher Before jumping into inference for regression, let’s remind ourselves of the University of Texas Austin teaching evaluations analysis in Section 5.1. 10.1.1 Teaching evaluations analysis Recall using simple linear regression we modeled the relationship between A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) (the instructor’s teaching score) and A single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) (the instructor’s “beauty” score). We first created an evals_ch5 data frame that selected a subset of variables from the evals data frame included in the moderndive package. This evals_ch5 data frame contains only the variables of interest for our analysis, in particular the instructor’s teaching score and the “beauty” rating bty_avg: evals_ch5 &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(ID, score, bty_avg, age) glimpse(evals_ch5) Rows: 463 Columns: 4 $ ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,… $ score &lt;dbl&gt; 4.7, 4.1, 3.9, 4.8, 4.6, 4.3, 2.8, 4.1, 3.4, 4.5, 3.8, 4.5, 4.… $ bty_avg &lt;dbl&gt; 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.33, 3.33, 3.17, 3.… $ age &lt;int&gt; 36, 36, 36, 36, 59, 59, 59, 51, 51, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40… In Subsection 5.1.1, we performed an exploratory data analysis of the relationship between these two variables of score and bty_avg. We saw there that a weakly positive correlation of 0.187 existed between the two variables. This was evidenced in Figure 10.1 of the scatterplot along with the “best-fitting” regression line that summarizes the linear relationship between the two variables of score and bty_avg. Recall in Subsection 5.3.2 that we defined a “best-fitting” line as the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. ggplot(evals_ch5, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between teaching and beauty scores&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) FIGURE 10.1: Relationship with regression line. Looking at this plot again, you might be asking, “Does that line really have all that positive of a slope?”. It does increase from left to right as the bty_avg variable increases, but by how much? To get to this information, recall that we followed a two-step procedure: We first “fit” the linear regression model using the lm() function with the formula score ~ bty_avg. We saved this model in score_model. We get the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function from the moderndive package to score_model. # Fit regression model: score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch5) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(score_model) TABLE 10.1: TABLE 10.2: Previously seen linear regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 Using the values in the estimate column of the resulting regression table in Table 10.1, we could then obtain the equation of the “best-fitting” regression line in Figure 10.1: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\\\ \\widehat{\\text{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{bty}\\_\\text{avg}} \\cdot\\text{bty}\\_\\text{avg}\\\\ &amp;= 3.880 + 0.067\\cdot\\text{bty}\\_\\text{avg} \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(b_0\\) is the fitted intercept and \\(b_1\\) is the fitted slope for bty_avg. Recall the interpretation of the \\(b_1\\) = 0.067 value of the fitted slope: For every increase of one unit in “beauty” rating, there is an associated increase, on average, of 0.067 units of evaluation score. Thus, the slope value quantifies the relationship between the \\(y\\) variable score and the \\(x\\) variable bty_avg. We also discussed the intercept value of \\(b_0\\) = 3.88 and its lack of practical interpretation, since the range of possible “beauty” scores does not include 0. 10.1.2 Sampling scenario Let’s now revisit this study in terms of the terminology and notation related to sampling we studied in Subsection 7.2.1. First, let’s view the instructors for these 463 courses as a representative sample from a greater study population. In our case, let’s assume that the study population is all instructors at UT Austin and that the sample of instructors who taught these 463 courses is a representative sample. Unfortunately, we can only assume these two facts without more knowledge of the sampling methodology used by the researchers. Since we are viewing these \\(n\\) = 463 courses as a sample, we can view our fitted slope \\(b_1\\) = 0.067 as a point estimate of the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\). In other words, \\(\\beta_1\\) quantifies the relationship between teaching score and “beauty” average bty_avg for all instructors at UT Austin. Similarly, we can view our fitted intercept \\(b_0\\) = 3.88 as a point estimate of the population intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) for all instructors at UT Austin. Putting these two ideas together, we can view the equation of the fitted line \\(\\widehat{y}\\) = \\(b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\) = \\(3.880 + 0.067 \\cdot \\text{bty}\\_\\text{avg}\\) as an estimate of some true and unknown population line \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x\\). Thus we can draw parallels between our teaching evaluations analysis and all the sampling scenarios we’ve seen previously. In this chapter, we’ll focus on the final scenario of regression slopes as shown in Table 10.3. TABLE 10.3: TABLE 10.4: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}_1 - \\widehat{\\mu}_2\\) 5 Population regression slope \\(\\beta_1\\) Fitted regression slope \\(b_1\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) Since we are now viewing our fitted slope \\(b_1\\) and fitted intercept \\(b_0\\) as point estimates based on a sample, these estimates will again be subject to sampling variability. In other words, if we collected a new sample of data on a different set of \\(n\\) = 463 courses and their instructors, the new fitted slope \\(b_1\\) will likely differ from 0.067. The same goes for the new fitted intercept \\(b_0\\). But by how much will these estimates vary? This information is in the remaining columns of the regression table in Table 10.1. Our knowledge of sampling from Chapter 7, confidence intervals from Chapter 8, and hypothesis tests from Chapter 9 will help us interpret these remaining columns. 10.2 Interpreting regression tables We’ve so far focused only on the two leftmost columns of the regression table in Table 10.1: term and estimate. Let’s now shift our attention to the remaining columns: std_error, statistic, p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci in Table 10.5. TABLE 10.5: TABLE 10.6: Previously seen regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 Given the lack of practical interpretation for the fitted intercept \\(b_0\\), in this section we’ll focus only on the second row of the table corresponding to the fitted slope \\(b_1\\). We’ll first interpret the std_error, statistic, p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci columns. Afterwards in the upcoming Subsection 10.2.5, we’ll discuss how R computes these values. 10.2.1 Standard error The third column of the regression table in Table 10.1 std_error corresponds to the standard error of our estimates. Recall the definition of standard error we saw in Subsection ??: The standard error is the standard deviation of any point estimate computed from a sample. So what does this mean in terms of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) = 0.067? This value is just one possible value of the fitted slope resulting from this particular sample of \\(n\\) = 463 pairs of teaching and “beauty” scores. However, if we collected a different sample of \\(n\\) = 463 pairs of teaching and “beauty” scores, we will almost certainly obtain a different fitted slope \\(b_1\\). This is due to sampling variability. Say we hypothetically collected 1000 such samples of pairs of teaching and “beauty” scores, computed the 1000 resulting values of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\), and visualized them in a histogram. This would be a visualization of the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\), which we defined in Subsection ??. Further recall that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\) has a special name: the standard error. Recall that we constructed three sampling distributions for the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) using shovels of size 25, 50, and 100 in Figure 7.12. We observed that as the sample size increased, the standard error decreased as evidenced by the narrowing sampling distribution. The standard error of \\(b_1\\) similarly quantifies how much variation in the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) one would expect between different samples. So in our case, we can expect about 0.016 units of variation in the bty_avg slope variable. Recall that the estimate and std_error values play a key role in inferring the value of the unknown population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) relating to all instructors. In Section 10.4, we’ll perform a simulation using the infer package to construct the bootstrap distribution for \\(b_1\\) in this case. Recall from Subsection ?? that the bootstrap distribution is an approximation to the sampling distribution in that they have a similar shape. Since they have a similar shape, they have similar standard errors. However, unlike the sampling distribution, the bootstrap distribution is constructed from a single sample, which is a practice more aligned with what’s done in real life. 10.2.2 Test statistic The fourth column of the regression table in Table 10.1 statistic corresponds to a test statistic relating to the following hypothesis test: \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: \\beta_1 = 0\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A&amp;: \\beta_1 \\neq 0. \\end{aligned} \\] Recall our terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis tests we introduced in Section 9.2. A hypothesis test consists of a test between two competing hypotheses: (1) a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) versus (2) an alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\). A test statistic is a point estimate/sample statistic formula used for hypothesis testing. Here, our null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) assumes that the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is 0. If the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is truly 0, then this is saying that there is no true relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores for all the instructors in our population. In other words, \\(x\\) = “beauty” score would have no associated effect on \\(y\\) = teaching score. The alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\), on the other hand, assumes that the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is not 0, meaning it could be either positive or negative. This suggests either a positive or negative relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores. Recall we called such alternative hypotheses two-sided. By convention, all hypothesis testing for regression assumes two-sided alternatives. Recall our “hypothesized universe” of no gender discrimination we assumed in our promotions activity in Section 9.1. Similarly here when conducting this hypothesis test, we’ll assume a “hypothesized universe” where there is no relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores. In other words, we’ll assume the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) is true. The statistic column in the regression table is a tricky one, however. It corresponds to a standardized t-test statistic, much like the two-sample \\(t\\) statistic we saw in Subsection 9.6.1 where we used a theory-based method for conducting hypothesis tests. In both these cases, the null distribution can be mathematically proven to be a \\(t\\)-distribution. Since such test statistics are tricky for individuals new to statistical inference to study, we’ll skip this and jump into interpreting the \\(p\\)-value. If you’re curious, we have included a discussion of this standardized t-test statistic in Subsection 10.5.1. 10.2.3 p-value The fifth column of the regression table in Table 10.1 p_value corresponds to the p-value of the hypothesis test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). Again recalling our terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis tests we introduced in Section 9.2, let’s focus on the definition of the \\(p\\)-value: A p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Recall that you can intuitively think of the \\(p\\)-value as quantifying how “extreme” the observed fitted slope of \\(b_1\\) = 0.067 is in a “hypothesized universe” where there is no relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores. Following the hypothesis testing procedure we outlined in Section 9.4, since the \\(p\\)-value in this case is 0, for any choice of significance level \\(\\alpha\\) we would reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\). Using non-statistical language, this is saying: we reject the hypothesis that there is no relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores in favor of the hypothesis that there is. That is to say, the evidence suggests there is a significant relationship, one that is positive. More precisely, however, the \\(p\\)-value corresponds to how extreme the observed test statistic of 4.09 is when compared to the appropriate null distribution. In Section 10.4, we’ll perform a simulation using the infer package to construct the null distribution in this case. An extra caveat here is that the results of this hypothesis test are only valid if certain “conditions for inference for regression” are met, which we’ll introduce shortly in Section 10.3. 10.2.4 Confidence interval The two rightmost columns of the regression table in Table 10.1 (lower_ci and upper_ci) correspond to the endpoints of the 95% confidence interval for the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\). Recall our analogy of “nets are to fish” what “confidence intervals are to population parameters” from Section ??. The resulting 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) of (0.035, 0.099) can be thought of as a range of plausible values for the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) of the linear relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores. As we introduced in Subsection ?? on the precise and shorthand interpretation of confidence intervals, the statistically precise interpretation of this confidence interval is: “if we repeated this sampling procedure a large number of times, we expect about 95% of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\).” However, we’ll summarize this using our shorthand interpretation that “we’re 95% ‘confident’ that the true population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) lies between 0.035 and 0.099.” Notice in this case that the resulting 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) of \\((0.035, \\, 0.099)\\) does not contain a very particular value: \\(\\beta_1\\) equals 0. Recall we mentioned that if the population regression slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is 0, this is equivalent to saying there is no relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores. Since \\(\\beta_1\\) = 0 is not in our plausible range of values for \\(\\beta_1\\), we are inclined to believe that there, in fact, is a relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores and a positive one at that. So in this case, the conclusion about the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) from the 95% confidence interval matches the conclusion from the hypothesis test: evidence suggests that there is a meaningful relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores. Recall from Subsection 8.2.5.1, however, that the confidence level is one of many factors that determine confidence interval widths. So for example, say we used a higher confidence level of 99% instead of 95%. The resulting confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) would be wider and thus might now include 0. The lesson to remember here is that any confidence-interval-based conclusion depends highly on the confidence level used. What are the calculations that went into computing the two endpoints of the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\)? Recall our sampling bowl example from Subsection ?? discussing lower_ci and upper_ci. Since the sampling and bootstrap distributions of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) were roughly normal, we could use the rule of thumb for bell-shaped distributions from Appendix A.2 to create a 95% confidence interval for \\(p\\) with the following equation: \\[\\widehat{p} \\pm \\text{MoE}_{\\widehat{p}} = \\widehat{p} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\widehat{p}} = \\widehat{p} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] We can generalize this to other point estimates that have roughly normally shaped sampling and/or bootstrap distributions: \\[\\text{point estimate} \\pm \\text{MoE} = \\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}.\\] We’ll show in Section 10.4 that the sampling/bootstrap distribution for the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) is in fact bell-shaped as well. Thus we can construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) with the following equation: \\[b_1 \\pm \\text{MoE}_{b_1} = b_1 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}_{b_1}.\\] What is the value of the standard error \\(\\text{SE}_{b_1}\\)? It is in fact in the third column of the regression table in Table 10.1: 0.016. Thus \\[ \\begin{aligned} b_1 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}_{b_1} &amp;= 0.067 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot 0.016 = 0.067 \\pm 0.031\\\\ &amp;= (0.036, 0.098) \\end{aligned} \\] This closely matches the \\((0.035, 0.099)\\) confidence interval in the last two columns of Table 10.1. Much like hypothesis tests, however, the results of this confidence interval also are only valid if the “conditions for inference for regression” to be discussed in Section 10.3 are met. 10.2.5 How does R compute the table? Since we didn’t perform the simulation to get the values of the standard error, test statistic, \\(p\\)-value, and endpoints of the 95% confidence interval in Table 10.1, you might be wondering how were these values computed. What did R do behind the scenes? Does R run simulations like we did using the infer package in Chapters 8 and 9 on confidence intervals and hypothesis testing? The answer is no! Much like the theory-based method for constructing confidence intervals you saw in Subsection ?? and the theory-based hypothesis test you saw in Subsection 9.6.1, there exist mathematical formulas that allow you to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests for inference for regression. These formulas were derived in a time when computers didn’t exist, so it would’ve been impossible to run the extensive computer simulations we have in this book. We present these formulas in Subsection 10.5.1 on “theory-based inference for regression.” In Section 10.4, we’ll go over a simulation-based approach to constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests using the infer package. In particular, we’ll convince you that the bootstrap distribution of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) is indeed bell-shaped. 10.3 Conditions for inference for regression Recall in Subsection ?? we stated that we could only use the standard-error-based method for constructing confidence intervals if the bootstrap distribution was bell shaped. Similarly, there are certain conditions that need to be met in order for the results of our hypothesis tests and confidence intervals we described in Section 10.2 to have valid meaning. These conditions must be met for the assumed underlying mathematical and probability theory to hold true. For inference for regression, there are four conditions that need to be met. Note the first four letters of these conditions are highlighted in bold in what follows: LINE. This can serve as a nice reminder of what to check for whenever you perform linear regression. Linearity of relationship between variables Independence of the residuals Normality of the residuals Equality of variance of the residuals Conditions L, N, and E can be verified through what is known as a residual analysis. Condition I can only be verified through an understanding of how the data was collected. In this section, we’ll go over a refresher on residuals, verify whether each of the four LINE conditions hold true, and then discuss the implications. 10.3.1 Residuals refresher Recall our definition of a residual from Subsection 5.1.3: it is the observed value minus the fitted value denoted by \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\). Recall that residuals can be thought of as the error or the “lack-of-fit” between the observed value \\(y\\) and the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) on the regression line in Figure 10.1. In Figure 10.2, we illustrate one particular residual out of 463 using an arrow, as well as its corresponding observed and fitted values using a circle and a square, respectively. FIGURE 10.2: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual. Furthermore, we can automate the calculation of all \\(n\\) = 463 residuals by applying the get_regression_points() function to our saved regression model in score_model. Observe how the resulting values of residual are roughly equal to score - score_hat (there is potentially a slight difference due to rounding error). # Fit regression model: score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch5) # Get regression points: regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(score_model) regression_points # A tibble: 463 × 5 ID score bty_avg score_hat residual &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 4.7 5 4.214 0.486 2 2 4.1 5 4.214 -0.114 3 3 3.9 5 4.214 -0.314 4 4 4.8 5 4.214 0.586 5 5 4.6 3 4.08 0.52 6 6 4.3 3 4.08 0.22 7 7 2.8 3 4.08 -1.28 8 8 4.1 3.333 4.102 -0.002 9 9 3.4 3.333 4.102 -0.702 10 10 4.5 3.167 4.091 0.409 # ℹ 453 more rows A residual analysis is used to verify conditions L, N, and E and can be performed using appropriate data visualizations. While there are more sophisticated statistical approaches that can also be done, we’ll focus on the much simpler approach of looking at plots. 10.3.2 Linearity of relationship The first condition is that the relationship between the outcome variable \\(y\\) and the explanatory variable \\(x\\) must be Linear. Recall the scatterplot in Figure 10.1 where we had the explanatory variable \\(x\\) as “beauty” score and the outcome variable \\(y\\) as teaching score. Would you say that the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is linear? It’s hard to say because of the scatter of the points about the line. In the authors’ opinions, we feel this relationship is “linear enough.” Let’s present an example where the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is clearly not linear in Figure 10.3. In this case, the points clearly do not form a line, but rather a U-shaped polynomial curve. In this case, any results from an inference for regression would not be valid. FIGURE 10.3: Example of a clearly non-linear relationship. 10.3.3 Independence of residuals The second condition is that the residuals must be Independent. In other words, the different observations in our data must be independent of one another. For our UT Austin data, while there is data on 463 courses, these 463 courses were actually taught by 94 unique instructors. In other words, the same professor is often included more than once in our data. The original evals data frame that we used to construct the evals_ch5 data frame has a variable prof_ID, which is an anonymized identification variable for the professor: evals %&gt;% select(ID, prof_ID, score, bty_avg) # A tibble: 463 × 4 ID prof_ID score bty_avg &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 1 4.7 5 2 2 1 4.1 5 3 3 1 3.9 5 4 4 1 4.8 5 5 5 2 4.6 3 6 6 2 4.3 3 7 7 2 2.8 3 8 8 3 4.1 3.333 9 9 3 3.4 3.333 10 10 4 4.5 3.167 # ℹ 453 more rows For example, the professor with prof_ID equal to 1 taught the first 4 courses in the data, the professor with prof_ID equal to 2 taught the next 3, and so on. Given that the same professor taught these first four courses, it is reasonable to expect that these four teaching scores are related to each other. If a professor gets a high score in one class, chances are fairly good they’ll get a high score in another. This dataset thus provides different information than if we had 463 unique instructors teaching the 463 courses. In this case, we say there exists dependence between observations. The first four courses taught by professor 1 are dependent, the next 3 courses taught by professor 2 are related, and so on. Any proper analysis of this data needs to take into account that we have repeated measures for the same profs. So in this case, the independence condition is not met. What does this mean for our analysis? We’ll address this in Subsection 10.3.6 coming up, after we check the remaining two conditions. 10.3.4 Normality of residuals The third condition is that the residuals should follow a Normal distribution. Furthermore, the center of this distribution should be 0. In other words, sometimes the regression model will make positive errors: \\(y - \\widehat{y} &gt; 0\\). Other times, the regression model will make equally negative errors: \\(y - \\widehat{y} &lt; 0\\). However, on average the errors should equal 0 and their shape should be similar to that of a bell. The simplest way to check the normality of the residuals is to look at a histogram, which we visualize in Figure 10.4. ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) FIGURE 10.4: Histogram of residuals. This histogram shows that we have more positive residuals than negative. Since the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) is positive when \\(y &gt; \\widehat{y}\\), it seems our regression model’s fitted teaching scores \\(\\widehat{y}\\) tend to underestimate the true teaching scores \\(y\\). Furthermore, this histogram has a slight left-skew in that there is a tail on the left. This is another way to say the residuals exhibit a negative skew. Is this a problem? Again, there is a certain amount of subjectivity in the response. In the authors’ opinion, while there is a slight skew to the residuals, we feel it isn’t drastic. On the other hand, others might disagree with our assessment. Let’s present examples where the residuals clearly do and don’t follow a normal distribution in Figure 10.5. In this case of the model yielding the clearly non-normal residuals on the right, any results from an inference for regression would not be valid. FIGURE 10.5: Example of clearly normal and clearly not normal residuals. 10.3.5 Equality of variance The fourth and final condition is that the residuals should exhibit Equal variance across all values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). In other words, the value and spread of the residuals should not depend on the value of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). Recall the scatterplot in Figure 10.1: we had the explanatory variable \\(x\\) of “beauty” score on the x-axis and the outcome variable \\(y\\) of teaching score on the y-axis. Instead, let’s create a scatterplot that has the same values on the x-axis, but now with the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) on the y-axis as seen in Figure 10.6. ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = bty_avg, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 1) FIGURE 10.6: Plot of residuals over beauty score. You can think of Figure 10.6 as a modified version of the plot with the regression line in Figure 10.1, but with the regression line flattened out to \\(y=0\\). Looking at this plot, would you say that the spread of the residuals around the line at \\(y=0\\) is constant across all values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\) of “beauty” score? This question is rather qualitative and subjective in nature, thus different people may respond with different answers. For example, some people might say that there is slightly more variation in the residuals for smaller values of \\(x\\) than for higher ones. However, it can be argued that there isn’t a drastic non-constancy. In Figure 10.7 let’s present an example where the residuals clearly do not have equal variance across all values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). FIGURE 10.7: Example of clearly non-equal variance. Observe how the spread of the residuals increases as the value of \\(x\\) increases. This is a situation known as heteroskedasticity. Any inference for regression based on a model yielding such a pattern in the residuals would not be valid. 10.3.6 What’s the conclusion? Let’s list our four conditions for inference for regression again and indicate whether or not they were satisfied in our analysis: Linearity of relationship between variables: Yes Independence of residuals: No Normality of residuals: Somewhat Equality of variance: Yes So what does this mean for the results of our confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in Section 10.2? First, the Independence condition. The fact that there exist dependencies between different rows in evals_ch5 must be addressed. In more advanced statistics courses, you’ll learn how to incorporate such dependencies into your regression models. One such technique is called hierarchical/multilevel modeling. Second, when conditions L, N, E are not met, it often means there is a shortcoming in our model. For example, it may be the case that using only a single explanatory variable is insufficient, as we did with “beauty” score. We may need to incorporate more explanatory variables in a multiple regression model as we did in Chapter 6, or perhaps use a transformation of one or more of your variables, or use an entirely different modeling technique. To learn more about addressing such shortcomings, you’ll have to take a class on or read up on more advanced regression modeling methods. In our case, the best we can do is view the results suggested by our confidence intervals and hypothesis tests as preliminary. While a preliminary analysis suggests that there is a significant relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores, further investigation is warranted; in particular, by improving the preliminary score ~ bty_avg model so that the four conditions are met. When the four conditions are roughly met, then we can put more faith into our confidence intervals and \\(p\\)-values. The conditions for inference in regression problems are a key part of regression analysis that are of vital importance to the processes of constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests. However, it is often the case with regression analysis in the real world that not all the conditions are completely met. Furthermore, as you saw, there is a level of subjectivity in the residual analyses to verify the L, N, and E conditions. So what can you do? We as authors advocate for transparency in communicating all results. This lets the stakeholders of any analysis know about a model’s shortcomings or whether the model is “good enough.” So while this checking of assumptions has lead to some fuzzy “it depends” results, we decided as authors to show you these scenarios to help prepare you for difficult statistical decisions you may need to make down the road. Learning check (LC10.1) Continuing with our regression using age as the explanatory variable and teaching score as the outcome variable. Use the get_regression_points() function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 463 instructors. Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Ideally, there should be little to no pattern but comment on what you find here. 10.4 Simulation-based inference for regression Recall in Subsection 10.2.5 when we interpreted the third through seventh columns of a regression table, we stated that R doesn’t do simulations to compute these values. Rather R uses theory-based methods that involve mathematical formulas. In this section, we’ll use the simulation-based methods you previously learned in Chapters 8 and 9 to recreate the values in the regression table in Table 10.1. In particular, we’ll use the infer package workflow to Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) using bootstrap resampling with replacement. We did this previously in Sections 8.3.2 with the pennies data and 8.5 with the mythbusters_yawn data. Conduct a hypothesis test of \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\) using a permutation test. We did this previously in Sections 9.3 with the promotions data and 9.5 with the movies_sample IMDb data. 10.4.1 Confidence interval for slope We’ll construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) using the infer workflow outlined in Subsection 8.3.3. Specifically, we’ll first construct the bootstrap distribution for the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) using our single sample of 463 courses: specify() the variables of interest in evals_ch5 with the formula: score ~ bty_avg. generate() replicates by using bootstrap resampling with replacement from the original sample of 463 courses. We generate reps = 1000 replicates using type = \"bootstrap\". calculate() the summary statistic of interest: the fitted slope \\(b_1\\). Using this bootstrap distribution, we’ll construct the 95% confidence interval using the percentile method and (if appropriate) the standard error method as well. It is important to note in this case that the bootstrapping with replacement is done row-by-row. Thus, the original pairs of score and bty_avg values are always kept together, but different pairs of score and bty_avg values may be resampled multiple times. The resulting confidence interval will denote a range of plausible values for the unknown population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) quantifying the relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores for all professors at UT Austin. Let’s first construct the bootstrap distribution for the fitted slope \\(b_1\\): bootstrap_distn_slope &lt;- evals_ch5 %&gt;% specify(formula = score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) bootstrap_distn_slope # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.0651055 2 2 0.0382313 3 3 0.108056 4 4 0.0666601 5 5 0.0715932 6 6 0.0854565 7 7 0.0624868 8 8 0.0412859 9 9 0.0796269 10 10 0.0761299 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe how we have 1000 values of the bootstrapped slope \\(b_1\\) in the stat column. Let’s visualize the 1000 bootstrapped values in Figure 10.8. visualize(bootstrap_distn_slope) FIGURE 10.8: Bootstrap distribution of slope. Observe how the bootstrap distribution is roughly bell-shaped. Recall from Subsection ?? that the shape of the bootstrap distribution of \\(b_1\\) closely approximates the shape of the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\). Percentile-method First, let’s compute the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) using the percentile method. We’ll do so by identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles which include the middle 95% of values. Recall that this method does not require the bootstrap distribution to be normally shaped. percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distn_slope %&gt;% get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;percentile&quot;, level = 0.95) percentile_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0323411 0.0990027 The resulting percentile-based 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) of (0.032, 0.099) is similar to the confidence interval in the regression Table 10.1 of (0.035, 0.099). Standard error method Since the bootstrap distribution in Figure 10.8 appears to be roughly bell-shaped, we can also construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) using the standard error method. In order to do this, we need to first compute the fitted slope \\(b_1\\), which will act as the center of our standard error-based confidence interval. While we saw in the regression table in Table 10.1 that this was \\(b_1\\) = 0.067, we can also use the infer pipeline with the generate() step removed to calculate it: observed_slope &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) observed_slope Response: score (numeric) Explanatory: bty_avg (numeric) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0666370 We then use the get_ci() function with level = 0.95 to compute the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\). Note that setting the point_estimate argument to the observed_slope of 0.067 sets the center of the confidence interval. se_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distn_slope %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.95, type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = observed_slope) se_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0333767 0.0998974 The resulting standard error-based 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) of \\((0.033, 0.1)\\) is slightly different than the confidence interval in the regression Table 10.1 of \\((0.035, 0.099)\\). Comparing all three Let’s compare all three confidence intervals in Figure 10.9, where the percentile-based confidence interval is marked with solid lines, the standard error based confidence interval is marked with dashed lines, and the theory-based confidence interval (0.035, 0.099) from the regression table in Table 10.1 is marked with dotted lines. visualize(bootstrap_distn_slope) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci, fill = NULL, linetype = &quot;solid&quot;, color = &quot;grey90&quot;) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = se_ci, fill = NULL, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;, color = &quot;grey60&quot;) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = c(0.035, 0.099), fill = NULL, linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) FIGURE 10.9: Comparing three confidence intervals for the slope. Observe that all three are quite similar! Furthermore, none of the three confidence intervals for \\(\\beta_1\\) contain 0 and are entirely located above 0. This is suggesting that there is in fact a meaningful positive relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores. 10.4.2 Hypothesis test for slope Let’s now conduct a hypothesis test of \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) vs. \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). We will use the infer package, which follows the hypothesis testing paradigm in the “There is only one test” diagram in Figure 9.10. Let’s first think about what it means for \\(\\beta_1\\) to be zero as assumed in the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). Recall we said if \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), then this is saying there is no relationship between the teaching and “beauty” scores. Thus assuming this particular null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) means that in our “hypothesized universe” there is no relationship between score and bty_avg. We can therefore shuffle/permute the bty_avg variable to no consequence. We construct the null distribution of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) by performing the steps that follow. Recall from Section 9.2 on terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis testing where we defined the null distribution: the sampling distribution of our test statistic \\(b_1\\) assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. specify() the variables of interest in evals_ch5 with the formula: score ~ bty_avg. hypothesize() the null hypothesis of independence. Recall from Section 9.3 that this is an additional step that needs to be added for hypothesis testing. generate() replicates by permuting/shuffling values from the original sample of 463 courses. We generate reps = 1000 replicates using type = \"permute\" here. calculate() the test statistic of interest: the fitted slope \\(b_1\\). In this case, we permute the values of bty_avg across the values of score 1000 times. We can do this shuffling/permuting since we assumed a “hypothesized universe” of no relationship between these two variables. Then we calculate the \"slope\" coefficient for each of these 1000 generated samples. null_distn_slope &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) Observe the resulting null distribution for the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) in Figure 10.10. FIGURE 10.10: Null distribution of slopes. Notice how it is centered at \\(b_1\\) = 0. This is because in our hypothesized universe, there is no relationship between score and bty_avg and so \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\). Thus, the most typical fitted slope \\(b_1\\) we observe across our simulations is 0. Observe, furthermore, how there is variation around this central value of 0. Let’s visualize the \\(p\\)-value in the null distribution by comparing it to the observed test statistic of \\(b_1\\) = 0.067 in Figure 10.11. We’ll do this by adding a shade_p_value() layer to the previous visualize() code. FIGURE 10.11: Null distribution and \\(p\\)-value. Since the observed fitted slope 0.067 falls far to the right of this null distribution and thus the shaded region doesn’t overlap it, we’ll have a \\(p\\)-value of 0. For completeness, however, let’s compute the numerical value of the \\(p\\)-value anyways using the get_p_value() function. Recall that it takes the same inputs as the shade_p_value() function: null_distn_slope %&gt;% get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_slope, direction = &quot;both&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 This matches the \\(p\\)-value of 0 in the regression table in Table 10.1. We therefore reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) in favor of the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). We thus have evidence that suggests there is a significant relationship between teaching and “beauty” scores for all instructors at UT Austin. When the conditions for inference for regression are met and the null distribution has a bell shape, we are likely to see similar results between the simulation-based results we just demonstrated and the theory-based results shown in the regression table in Table 10.1. Learning check (LC10.2) Repeat the inference but this time for the correlation coefficient instead of the slope. Note the implementation of stat = \"correlation\" in the calculate() function of the infer package. 10.5 Conclusion 10.5.1 Theory-based inference for regression Recall in Subsection 10.2.5 when we interpreted the regression table in Table 10.1, we mentioned that R does not compute its values using simulation-based methods for constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests as we did in Chapters 8 and 9 using the infer package. Rather, R uses a theory-based approach using mathematical formulas, much like the theory-based confidence intervals you saw in Subsection ?? and the theory-based hypothesis tests you saw in Subsection 9.6.1. These formulas were derived in a time when computers didn’t exist, so it would’ve been incredibly labor intensive to run extensive simulations. In particular, much like the formula for the standard error for the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) we saw in Subsection ?? and the formula for the standard error for the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) we saw in Subsection 9.6.1, there is a formula for the standard error of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\): \\[\\text{SE}_{b_1} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{s_y}{s_x} \\cdot \\sqrt{1-r^2}}{\\sqrt{n-2}}\\] As with many formulas in statistics, there’s a lot going on here, so let’s first break down what each symbol represents. First \\(s_x\\) and \\(s_y\\) are the sample standard deviations of the explanatory variable bty_avg and the response variable score, respectively. Second, \\(r\\) is the sample correlation coefficient between score and bty_avg. This was computed as 0.187 in Chapter 5. Lastly, \\(n\\) is the number of pairs of points in the evals_ch5 data frame, here 463. To put this formula into words, the standard error of \\(b_1\\) depends on the relationship between the variability of the response variable and the variability of the explanatory variable as measured in the \\(s_y / s_x\\) term. Next, it looks into how the two variables relate to each other in the \\(\\sqrt{1-r^2}\\) term. However, the most important observation to make in the previous formula is that there is an \\(n - 2\\) in the denominator. In other words, as the sample size \\(n\\) increases, the standard error \\(\\text{SE}_{b_1}\\) decreases. Just as we demonstrated in Subsection ?? when we used shovels with \\(n\\) = 25, 50, and 100 slots, the amount of sampling variation of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) will depend on the sample size \\(n\\). In particular, as the sample size increases, both the sampling and bootstrap distributions narrow and the standard error \\(\\text{SE}_{b_1}\\) decreases. Hence, our estimates of \\(b_1\\) for the true population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) get more and more precise. R then uses this formula for the standard error of \\(b_1\\) in the third column of the regression table and subsequently to construct 95% confidence intervals. But what about the hypothesis test? Much like with our theory-based hypothesis test in Subsection 9.6.1, R uses the following \\(t\\)-statistic as the test statistic for hypothesis testing: \\[ t = \\dfrac{ b_1 - \\beta_1}{ \\text{SE}_{b_1}} \\] And since the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) is assumed during the hypothesis test, the \\(t\\)-statistic becomes \\[ t = \\dfrac{ b_1 - 0}{ \\text{SE}_{b_1}} = \\dfrac{ b_1 }{ \\text{SE}_{b_1}} \\] What are the values of \\(b_1\\) and \\(\\text{SE}_{b_1}\\)? They are in the estimate and std_error column of the regression table in Table 10.1. Thus the value of 4.09 in the table is computed as 0.067/0.016 = 4.188. Note there is a difference due to some rounding error here. Lastly, to compute the \\(p\\)-value, we need to compare the observed test statistic of 4.09 to the appropriate null distribution. Recall from Section 9.2, that a null distribution is the sampling distribution of the test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Much like in our theory-based hypothesis test in Subsection 9.6.1, it can be mathematically proven that this distribution is a \\(t\\)-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 2 = 463 - 2 = 461\\). Don’t worry if you’re feeling a little overwhelmed at this point. There is a lot of background theory to understand before you can fully make sense of the equations for theory-based methods. That being said, theory-based methods and simulation-based methods for constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests often yield consistent results. As mentioned before, in our opinion, two large benefits of simulation-based methods over theory-based are that (1) they are easier for people new to statistical inference to understand, and (2) they also work in situations where theory-based methods and mathematical formulas don’t exist. 10.5.2 Summary of statistical inference We’ve finished the last two scenarios from the “Scenarios of sampling for inference” table in Subsection ??, which we re-display in Table 10.7. TABLE 10.7: TABLE 10.8: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}_1 - \\widehat{\\mu}_2\\) 5 Population regression slope \\(\\beta_1\\) Fitted regression slope \\(b_1\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) Armed with the regression modeling techniques you learned in Chapters 5 and 6, your understanding of sampling for inference in Chapter 7, and the tools for statistical inference like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in Chapters 8 and 9, you’re now equipped to study the significance of relationships between variables in a wide array of data! Many of the ideas presented here can be extended into multiple regression and other more advanced modeling techniques. 10.5.3 Additional resources An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. 10.5.4 What’s to come You’ve now concluded the last major part of the book on “Statistical Inference with infer.” The closing Chapter 11 concludes this book with various short case studies involving real data, such as house prices in the city of Seattle, Washington in the US. You’ll see how the principles in this book can help you become a great storyteller with data!

FIGURE 11.1: ModernDive flowchart. 11.1 Review Let’s go over a refresher of what you’ve covered so far. You first got started with data in Chapter 1 where you learned about the difference between R and RStudio, started coding in R, installed and loaded your first R packages, and explored your first dataset: all domestic departure flights from a major New York City airport in 2023. Then you covered the following three parts of this book (Parts 2 and 4 are combined into a single portion): Data science with tidyverse. You assembled your data science toolbox using tidyverse packages. In particular, you Ch.2: Visualized data using the ggplot2 package. Ch.3: Wrangled data using the dplyr package. Ch.4: Learned about the concept of “tidy” data as a standardized data frame input and output format for all packages in the tidyverse. Furthermore, you learned how to import spreadsheet files into R using the readr package. Statistical/Data modeling with moderndive. Using these data science tools and helper functions from the moderndive package, you fit your first data models. In particular, you Ch.5: Discovered basic regression models with only one explanatory variable. Ch.6: Examined multiple regression models with more than one explanatory variable. Statistical inference with infer. Once again using your newly acquired data science tools, you unpacked statistical inference using the infer package. In particular, you Ch.7: Learned about the role that sampling variability plays in statistical inference and the role that sample size plays in this sampling variability. Ch.8: Constructed confidence intervals using bootstrapping. Ch.9: Conducted hypothesis tests using permutation. Statistical/Data modeling with moderndive (revisited): Armed with your understanding of statistical inference, you revisited and reviewed the models you constructed in Ch.5 and Ch.6. In particular, you Ch.10: Interpreted confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in a regression setting. We’ve guided you through your first experiences of “thinking with data,” an expression originally coined by Dr. Diane Lambert. The philosophy underlying this expression guided your path in the flowchart in Figure 11.1. This philosophy is also well-summarized in “Practical Data Science for Stats”: a collection of pre-prints focusing on the practical side of data science workflows and statistical analysis curated by Dr. Jennifer Bryan and Dr. Hadley Wickham. They quote: There are many aspects of day-to-day analytical work that are almost absent from the conventional statistics literature and curriculum. And yet these activities account for a considerable share of the time and effort of data analysts and applied statisticians. The goal of this collection is to increase the visibility and adoption of modern data analytical workflows. We aim to facilitate the transfer of tools and frameworks between industry and academia, between software engineering and statistics and computer science, and across different domains. In other words, to be equipped to “think with data” in the 21st century, analysts need practice going through the “data/science pipeline” we saw in the Preface (re-displayed in Figure 11.2). It is our opinion that, for too long, statistics education has only focused on parts of this pipeline, instead of going through it in its entirety. FIGURE 11.2: Data/science pipeline. To conclude this book, we’ll present you with some additional case studies of working with data. In Section 11.2 we’ll take you through a full-pass of the “Data/Science Pipeline” in order to analyze the sale price of houses in Seattle, WA, USA. In Section 11.3, we’ll present you with some examples of effective data storytelling drawn from the data journalism website, FiveThirtyEight.com. We present these case studies to you because we believe that you should not only be able to “think with data,” but also be able to “tell your story with data.” Let’s explore how to do this! Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 1.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(skimr) library(fivethirtyeight) 11.2 Case study: Seattle house prices Kaggle.com is a machine learning and predictive modeling competition website that hosts datasets uploaded by companies, governmental organizations, and other individuals. One of their datasets is the “House Sales in King County, USA”. It consists of sale prices of homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County, Washington, USA, which includes the greater Seattle metropolitan area. This dataset is in the house_prices data frame included in the moderndive package. The dataset consists of 21,613 houses and 21 variables describing these houses (for a full list and description of these variables, see the help file by running ?house_prices in the console). In this case study, we’ll create a multiple regression model where: The outcome variable \\(y\\) is the sale price of houses. Two explanatory variables: A numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\): house size sqft_living as measured in square feet of living space. Note that 1 square foot is about 0.09 square meters. A categorical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\): house condition, a categorical variable with five levels where 1 indicates “poor” and 5 indicates “excellent.” 11.2.1 Exploratory data analysis: Part I As we’ve said numerous times throughout this book, a crucial first step when presented with data is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA). Exploratory data analysis can give you a sense of your data, help identify issues with your data, bring to light any outliers, and help inform model construction. Recall the three common steps in an exploratory data analysis we introduced in Subsection 5.1.1: Looking at the raw data values. Computing summary statistics. Creating data visualizations. First, let’s look at the raw data using View() to bring up RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer and the glimpse() function from the dplyr package: View(house_prices) glimpse(house_prices) Rows: 21,613 Columns: 21 $ id &lt;chr&gt; &quot;7129300520&quot;, &quot;6414100192&quot;, &quot;5631500400&quot;, &quot;2487200875&quot;, … $ date &lt;date&gt; 2014-10-13, 2014-12-09, 2015-02-25, 2014-12-09, 2015-02… $ price &lt;dbl&gt; 221900, 538000, 180000, 604000, 510000, 1225000, 257500,… $ bedrooms &lt;int&gt; 3, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 2,… $ bathrooms &lt;dbl&gt; 1.00, 2.25, 1.00, 3.00, 2.00, 4.50, 2.25, 1.50, 1.00, 2.… $ sqft_living &lt;int&gt; 1180, 2570, 770, 1960, 1680, 5420, 1715, 1060, 1780, 189… $ sqft_lot &lt;int&gt; 5650, 7242, 10000, 5000, 8080, 101930, 6819, 9711, 7470,… $ floors &lt;dbl&gt; 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1… $ waterfront &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, … $ view &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0,… $ condition &lt;fct&gt; 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4,… $ grade &lt;fct&gt; 7, 7, 6, 7, 8, 11, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7… $ sqft_above &lt;int&gt; 1180, 2170, 770, 1050, 1680, 3890, 1715, 1060, 1050, 189… $ sqft_basement &lt;int&gt; 0, 400, 0, 910, 0, 1530, 0, 0, 730, 0, 1700, 300, 0, 0, … $ yr_built &lt;int&gt; 1955, 1951, 1933, 1965, 1987, 2001, 1995, 1963, 1960, 20… $ yr_renovated &lt;int&gt; 0, 1991, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… $ zipcode &lt;fct&gt; 98178, 98125, 98028, 98136, 98074, 98053, 98003, 98198, … $ lat &lt;dbl&gt; 47.5, 47.7, 47.7, 47.5, 47.6, 47.7, 47.3, 47.4, 47.5, 47… $ long &lt;dbl&gt; -122, -122, -122, -122, -122, -122, -122, -122, -122, -1… $ sqft_living15 &lt;int&gt; 1340, 1690, 2720, 1360, 1800, 4760, 2238, 1650, 1780, 23… $ sqft_lot15 &lt;int&gt; 5650, 7639, 8062, 5000, 7503, 101930, 6819, 9711, 8113, … Here are some questions you can ask yourself at this stage of an EDA: Which variables are numerical? Which are categorical? For the categorical variables, what are their levels? Besides the variables we’ll be using in our regression model, what other variables do you think would be useful to use in a model for house price? Observe, for example, that while the condition variable has values 1 through 5, these are saved in R as fct standing for “factors.” This is one of R’s ways of saving categorical variables. So you should think of these as the “labels” 1 through 5 and not the numerical values 1 through 5. Let’s now perform the second step in an EDA: computing summary statistics. Recall from Section 3.3 that summary statistics are single numerical values that summarize a large number of values. Examples of summary statistics include the mean, the median, the standard deviation, and various percentiles. We could do this using the summarize() function in the dplyr package along with R’s built-in summary functions, like mean() and median(). However, recall in Section 3.5, we saw the following code that computes a variety of summary statistics of the variable gain, which is the amount of time that a flight makes up mid-air: gain_summary &lt;- flights %&gt;% summarize( min = min(gain, na.rm = TRUE), q1 = quantile(gain, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), median = quantile(gain, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE), q3 = quantile(gain, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), max = max(gain, na.rm = TRUE), mean = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(gain, na.rm = TRUE), missing = sum(is.na(gain)) ) To repeat this for all three price, sqft_living, and condition variables would be tedious to code up. So instead, let’s use the convenient skim() function from the skimr package we first used in Subsection 6.1.1, being sure to only select() the variables of interest for our model: house_prices %&gt;% select(price, sqft_living, condition) %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 21613 n variables: 3 ── Variable type:factor variable missing complete n n_unique top_counts ordered condition 0 21613 21613 5 3: 14031, 4: 5679, 5: 1701, 2: 172 FALSE ── Variable type:integer variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 sqft_living 0 21613 21613 2079.9 918.44 290 1427 1910 2550 13540 ── Variable type:numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 price 0 21613 21613 540088.14 367127.2 75000 321950 450000 645000 7700000 Observe that the mean price of $540,088 is larger than the median of $450,000. This is because a small number of very expensive houses are inflating the average. In other words, there are “outlier” house prices in our dataset. (This fact will become even more apparent when we create our visualizations next.) However, the median is not as sensitive to such outlier house prices. This is why news about the real estate market generally report median house prices and not mean/average house prices. We say here that the median is more robust to outliers than the mean. Similarly, while both the standard deviation and interquartile-range (IQR) are both measures of spread and variability, the IQR is more robust to outliers. Let’s now perform the last of the three common steps in an exploratory data analysis: creating data visualizations. Let’s first create univariate visualizations. These are plots focusing on a single variable at a time. Since price and sqft_living are numerical variables, we can visualize their distributions using a geom_histogram() as seen in Section 2.5 on histograms. On the other hand, since condition is categorical, we can visualize its distribution using a geom_bar(). Recall from Section 2.8 on barplots that since condition is not “pre-counted”, we use a geom_bar() and not a geom_col(). # Histogram of house price: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = price)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;price (USD)&quot;, title = &quot;House price&quot;) # Histogram of sqft_living: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = sqft_living)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;living space (square feet)&quot;, title = &quot;House size&quot;) # Barplot of condition: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = condition)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = &quot;condition&quot;, title = &quot;House condition&quot;) In Figure 11.3, we display all three of these visualizations at once. FIGURE 11.3: Exploratory visualizations of Seattle house prices data. First, observe in the bottom plot that most houses are of condition “3”, with a few more of conditions “4” and “5”, and almost none that are “1” or “2”. Next, observe in the histogram for price in the top-left plot that a majority of houses are less than two million dollars. Observe also that the x-axis stretches out to 8 million dollars, even though there does not appear to be any houses close to that price. This is because there are a very small number of houses with prices closer to 8 million. These are the outlier house prices we mentioned earlier. We say that the variable price is right-skewed as exhibited by the long right tail. Further, observe in the histogram of sqft_living in the middle plot as well that most houses appear to have less than 5000 square feet of living space. For comparison, a football field in the US is about 57,600 square feet, whereas a standard soccer/association football field is about 64,000 square feet. Observe also that this variable is also right-skewed, although not as drastically as the price variable. For both the price and sqft_living variables, the right-skew makes distinguishing houses at the lower end of the x-axis hard. This is because the scale of the x-axis is compressed by the small number of quite expensive and immensely-sized houses. So what can we do about this skew? Let’s apply a log10 transformation to these variables. If you are unfamiliar with such transformations, we highly recommend you read Appendix A.3 on logarithmic (log) transformations. In summary, log transformations allow us to alter the scale of a variable to focus on multiplicative changes instead of additive changes. In other words, they shift the view to be on relative changes instead of absolute changes. Such multiplicative/relative changes are also called changes in orders of magnitude. Let’s create new log10 transformed versions of the right-skewed variable price and sqft_living using the mutate() function from Section 3.5, but we’ll give the latter the name log10_size, which is shorter and easier to understand than the name log10_sqft_living. house_prices &lt;- house_prices %&gt;% mutate( log10_price = log10(price), log10_size = log10(sqft_living) ) Let’s display the before and after effects of this transformation on these variables for only the first 10 rows of house_prices: house_prices %&gt;% select(price, log10_price, sqft_living, log10_size) # A tibble: 21,613 × 4 price log10_price sqft_living log10_size &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 221900 5.34616 1180 3.07188 2 538000 5.73078 2570 3.40993 3 180000 5.25527 770 2.88649 4 604000 5.78104 1960 3.29226 5 510000 5.70757 1680 3.22531 6 1225000 6.08814 5420 3.73400 7 257500 5.41078 1715 3.23426 8 291850 5.46516 1060 3.02531 9 229500 5.36078 1780 3.25042 10 323000 5.50920 1890 3.27646 # ℹ 21,603 more rows Observe in particular the houses in the sixth and third rows. The house in the sixth row has price $1,225,000, which is just above one million dollars. Since \\(10^6\\) is one million, its log10_price is around 6.09. Contrast this with all other houses with log10_price less than six, since they all have price less than $1,000,000. The house in the third row is the only house with sqft_living less than 1000. Since \\(1000 = 10^3\\), it’s the lone house with log10_size less than 3. Let’s now visualize the before and after effects of this transformation for price in Figure 11.4. # Before log10 transformation: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = price)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;price (USD)&quot;, title = &quot;House price: Before&quot;) # After log10 transformation: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_price)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;log10 price (USD)&quot;, title = &quot;House price: After&quot;) FIGURE 11.4: House price before and after log10 transformation. Observe that after the transformation, the distribution is much less skewed, and in this case, more symmetric and more bell-shaped. Now you can more easily distinguish the lower priced houses. Let’s do the same for house size, where the variable sqft_living was log10 transformed to log10_size. # Before log10 transformation: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = sqft_living)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;living space (square feet)&quot;, title = &quot;House size: Before&quot;) # After log10 transformation: ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_size)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;log10 living space (square feet)&quot;, title = &quot;House size: After&quot;) FIGURE 11.5: House size before and after log10 transformation. Observe in Figure 11.5 that the log10 transformation has a similar effect of unskewing the variable. We emphasize that while in these two cases the resulting distributions are more symmetric and bell-shaped, this is not always necessarily the case. Given the now symmetric nature of log10_price and log10_size, we are going to revise our multiple regression model to use our new variables: The outcome variable \\(y\\) is the sale log10_price of houses. Two explanatory variables: A numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\): house size log10_size as measured in log base 10 square feet of living space. A categorical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\): house condition, a categorical variable with five levels where 1 indicates “poor” and 5 indicates “excellent.” 11.2.2 Exploratory data analysis: Part II Let’s now continue our EDA by creating multivariate visualizations. Unlike the univariate histograms and barplot in the earlier Figures 11.3, 11.4, and 11.5, multivariate visualizations show relationships between more than one variable. This is an important step of an EDA to perform since the goal of modeling is to explore relationships between variables. Since our model involves a numerical outcome variable, a numerical explanatory variable, and a categorical explanatory variable, we are in a similar regression modeling situation as in Section 6.1 where we studied the UT Austin teaching scores dataset. Recall in that case the numerical outcome variable was teaching score, the numerical explanatory variable was instructor age, and the categorical explanatory variable was (binary) gender. We thus have two choices of models we can fit: either (1) an interaction model where the regression line for each condition level will have both a different slope and a different intercept or (2) a parallel slopes model where the regression line for each condition level will have the same slope but different intercepts. Recall from Subsection 6.1.3 that the geom_parallel_slopes() function is a special purpose function that Evgeni Chasnovski created and included in the moderndive package, since the geom_smooth() method in the ggplot2 package does not have a convenient way to plot parallel slopes models. We plot both resulting models in Figure 11.6, with the interaction model on the left. # Plot interaction model ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_size, y = log10_price, col = condition)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.05) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(y = &quot;log10 price&quot;, x = &quot;log10 size&quot;, title = &quot;House prices in Seattle&quot;) # Plot parallel slopes model ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_size, y = log10_price, col = condition)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.05) + geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE) + labs(y = &quot;log10 price&quot;, x = &quot;log10 size&quot;, title = &quot;House prices in Seattle&quot;) FIGURE 11.6: Interaction and parallel slopes models. In both cases, we see there is a positive relationship between house price and size, meaning as houses are larger, they tend to be more expensive. Furthermore, in both plots it seems that houses of condition 5 tend to be the most expensive for most house sizes as evidenced by the fact that the line for condition 5 is highest, followed by conditions 4 and 3. As for conditions 1 and 2, this pattern isn’t as clear. Recall from the univariate barplot of condition in Figure 11.3, there are only a few houses of condition 1 or 2. Let’s also show a faceted version of just the interaction model in Figure 11.7. It is now much more apparent just how few houses are of condition 1 or 2. ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = log10_size, y = log10_price, col = condition)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(y = &quot;log10 price&quot;, x = &quot;log10 size&quot;, title = &quot;House prices in Seattle&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ condition) FIGURE 11.7: Faceted plot of interaction model. Which exploratory visualization of the interaction model is better, the one in the left-hand plot of Figure 11.6 or the faceted version in Figure 11.7? There is no universal right answer. You need to make a choice depending on what you want to convey, and own that choice, with including and discussing both also as an option as needed. 11.2.3 Regression modeling Which of the two models in Figure 11.6 is “better”? The interaction model in the left-hand plot or the parallel slopes model in the right-hand plot? We had a similar discussion in Subsection ?? on model selection. Recall that we stated that we should only favor more complex models if the additional complexity is warranted. In this case, the more complex model is the interaction model since it considers five intercepts and five slopes total. This is in contrast to the parallel slopes model which considers five intercepts but only one common slope. Is the additional complexity of the interaction model warranted? Looking at the left-hand plot in Figure 11.6, we’re of the opinion that it is, as evidenced by the slight x-like pattern to some of the lines. Therefore, we’ll focus the rest of this analysis only on the interaction model. This visual approach is somewhat subjective, however, so feel free to disagree! What are the five different slopes and five different intercepts for the interaction model? We can obtain these values from the regression table. Recall our two-step process for getting the regression table: # Fit regression model: price_interaction &lt;- lm(log10_price ~ log10_size * condition, data = house_prices) # Get regression table: get_regression_table(price_interaction) TABLE 11.1: TABLE 11.2: Regression table for interaction model term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 3.330 0.451 7.380 0.000 2.446 4.215 log10_size 0.690 0.148 4.652 0.000 0.399 0.980 condition: 2 0.047 0.498 0.094 0.925 -0.930 1.024 condition: 3 -0.367 0.452 -0.812 0.417 -1.253 0.519 condition: 4 -0.398 0.453 -0.879 0.380 -1.286 0.490 condition: 5 -0.883 0.457 -1.931 0.053 -1.779 0.013 log10_size:condition2 -0.024 0.163 -0.148 0.882 -0.344 0.295 log10_size:condition3 0.133 0.148 0.893 0.372 -0.158 0.424 log10_size:condition4 0.146 0.149 0.979 0.328 -0.146 0.437 log10_size:condition5 0.310 0.150 2.067 0.039 0.016 0.604 Recall we saw in Subsection 6.1.2 how to interpret a regression table when there are both numerical and categorical explanatory variables. Let’s now do the same for all 10 values in the estimate column of Table 11.1. In this case, the “baseline for comparison” group for the categorical variable condition are the condition 1 houses, since “1” comes first alphanumerically. Thus, the intercept and log10_size values are the intercept and slope for log10_size for this baseline group. Next, the condition2 through condition5 terms are the offsets in intercepts relative to the condition 1 intercept. Finally, the log10_size:condition2 through log10_size:condition5 are the offsets in slopes for log10_size relative to the condition 1 slope for log10_size. Let’s simplify this by writing out the equation of each of the five regression lines using these 10 estimate values. We’ll write out each line in the following format: \\[ \\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{size}} \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\] Condition 1: \\[\\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} = 3.33 + 0.69 \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size})\\] Condition 2: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} &amp;= (3.33 + 0.047) + (0.69 - 0.024) \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\\\ &amp;= 3.377 + 0.666 \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\end{aligned} \\] Condition 3: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} &amp;= (3.33 - 0.367) + (0.69 + 0.133) \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\\\ &amp;= 2.963 + 0.823 \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\end{aligned} \\] Condition 4: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} &amp;= (3.33 - 0.398) + (0.69 + 0.146) \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\\\ &amp;= 2.932 + 0.836 \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\end{aligned} \\] Condition 5: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\log10(\\text{price})} &amp;= (3.33 - 0.883) + (0.69 + 0.31) \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\\\ &amp;= 2.447 + 1 \\cdot \\log10(\\text{size}) \\end{aligned} \\] These correspond to the regression lines in the left-hand plot of Figure 11.6 and the faceted plot in Figure 11.7. For homes of all five condition types, as the size of the house increases, the price increases. This is what most would expect. However, the rate of increase of price with size is fastest for the homes with conditions 3, 4, and 5 of 0.823, 0.836, and 1, respectively. These are the three largest slopes out of the five. 11.2.4 Making predictions Say you’re a realtor and someone calls you asking you how much their home will sell for. They tell you that it’s in condition = 5 and is sized 1900 square feet. What do you tell them? Let’s use the interaction model we fit to make predictions! We first make this prediction visually in Figure 11.8. The predicted log10_price of this house is marked with a black dot. This is where the following two lines intersect: The regression line for the condition = 5 homes and The vertical dashed black line at log10_size equals 3.28, since our predictor variable is the log10 transformed square feet of living space of \\(\\log10(1900) = 3.28\\). FIGURE 11.8: Interaction model with prediction. Eyeballing it, it seems the predicted log10_price seems to be around 5.75. Let’s now obtain the exact numerical value for the prediction using the equation of the regression line for the condition = 5 houses, being sure to log10() the square footage first. 2.45 + 1 * log10(1900) [1] 5.73 This value is very close to our earlier visually made prediction of 5.75. But wait! Is our prediction for the price of this house $5.75? No! Remember that we are using log10_price as our outcome variable! So, if we want a prediction in dollar units of price, we need to unlog this by taking a power of 10 as described in Appendix A.3. 10^(2.45 + 1 * log10(1900)) [1] 535493 So our predicted price for this home of condition 5 and of size 1900 square feet is $535,493. Learning check (LC11.1) Repeat the regression modeling in Subsection 11.2.3 and the prediction making you just did on the house of condition 5 and size 1900 square feet in Subsection 11.2.4, but using the parallel slopes model you visualized in Figure 11.6. Show that it’s $524,807! 11.3 Case study: Effective data storytelling As we’ve progressed throughout this book, you’ve seen how to work with data in a variety of ways. You’ve learned effective strategies for plotting data by understanding which types of plots work best for which combinations of variable types. You’ve summarized data in spreadsheet form and calculated summary statistics for a variety of different variables. Furthermore, you’ve seen the value of statistical inference as a process to come to conclusions about a population by using sampling. Lastly, you’ve explored how to fit linear regression models and the importance of checking the conditions required so that all confidence intervals and hypothesis tests have valid interpretation. All throughout, you’ve learned many computational techniques and focused on writing R code that’s reproducible. We now present another set of case studies, but this time on the “effective data storytelling” done by data journalists around the world. Great data stories don’t mislead the reader, but rather engulf them in understanding the importance that data plays in our lives through storytelling. 11.3.1 Bechdel test for Hollywood gender representation We recommend you read and analyze Walt Hickey’s FiveThirtyEight.com article, “The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women.” In it, Walt completed a multidecade study of how many movies pass the Bechdel test, an informal test of gender representation in a movie that was created by Alison Bechdel. As you read over the article, think carefully about how Walt Hickey is using data, graphics, and analyses to tell the reader a story. In the spirit of reproducibility, FiveThirtyEight have also shared the data and R code that they used for this article. You can also find the data used in many more of their articles on their GitHub page. ModernDive co-authors Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim along with Jennifer Chunn went one step further by creating the fivethirtyeight package which provides access to these datasets more easily in R. For a complete list of all 129 datasets included in the fivethirtyeight package, check out the package webpage at https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/articles/fivethirtyeight.html. Furthermore, example “vignettes” of fully reproducible start-to-finish analyses of some of these data using dplyr, ggplot2, and other packages in the tidyverse are available here. For example, a vignette showing how to reproduce one of the plots at the end of the article on the Bechdel test is available here. 11.3.2 US Births in 1999 The US_births_1994_2003 data frame included in the fivethirtyeight package provides information about the number of daily births in the United States between 1994 and 2003. For more information on this data frame including a link to the original article on FiveThirtyEight.com, check out the help file by running ?US_births_1994_2003 in the console. It’s always a good idea to preview your data, either by using RStudio’s spreadsheet View() function or using glimpse() from the dplyr package: glimpse(US_births_1994_2003) Rows: 3,652 Columns: 6 $ year &lt;int&gt; 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 19… $ month &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,… $ date_of_month &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 1… $ date &lt;date&gt; 1994-01-01, 1994-01-02, 1994-01-03, 1994-01-04, 1994-01… $ day_of_week &lt;ord&gt; Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue… $ births &lt;int&gt; 8096, 7772, 10142, 11248, 11053, 11406, 11251, 8653, 791… We’ll focus on the number of births for each date, but only for births that occurred in 1999. Recall from Section 3.2 we can do this using the filter() function from the dplyr package: US_births_1999 &lt;- US_births_1994_2003 %&gt;% filter(year == 1999) As discussed in Section 2.4, since date is a notion of time and thus has sequential ordering to it, a linegraph would be a more appropriate visualization to use than a scatterplot. In other words, we should use a geom_line() instead of geom_point(). Recall that such plots are called time series plots. ggplot(US_births_1999, aes(x = date, y = births)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Date&quot;, y = &quot;Number of births&quot;, title = &quot;US Births in 1999&quot;) FIGURE 11.9: Number of births in the US in 1999. We see a big dip occurring just before January 1st, 2000, most likely due to the holiday season. However, what about the large spike of over 14,000 births occurring just before October 1st, 1999? What could be the reason for this anomalously high spike? Let’s sort the rows of US_births_1999 in descending order of the number of births. Recall from Section 3.6 that we can use the arrange() function from the dplyr function to do this, making sure to sort births in descending order: US_births_1999 %&gt;% arrange(desc(births)) # A tibble: 365 × 6 year month date_of_month date day_of_week births &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1999 9 9 1999-09-09 Thurs 14540 2 1999 12 21 1999-12-21 Tues 13508 3 1999 9 8 1999-09-08 Wed 13437 4 1999 9 21 1999-09-21 Tues 13384 5 1999 9 28 1999-09-28 Tues 13358 6 1999 7 7 1999-07-07 Wed 13343 7 1999 7 8 1999-07-08 Thurs 13245 8 1999 8 17 1999-08-17 Tues 13201 9 1999 9 10 1999-09-10 Fri 13181 10 1999 12 28 1999-12-28 Tues 13158 # ℹ 355 more rows The date with the highest number of births (14,540) is in fact 1999-09-09. If we write down this date in month/day/year format (a standard format in the US), the date with the highest number of births is 9/9/99! All nines! Could it be that parents deliberately induced labor at a higher rate on this date? Maybe? Whatever the cause may be, this fact makes a fun story! Learning check (LC11.2) What date between 1994 and 2003 has the fewest number of births in the US? What story could you tell about why this is the case? Time to think with data and further tell your story with data! How could statistical modeling help you here? What types of statistical inference would be helpful? What else can you find and where can you take this analysis? What assumptions did you make in this analysis? We leave these questions to you as the reader to explore and examine. Remember to get in touch with us via our contact info in the Preface. We’d love to see what you come up with!

You’ve also gained a lot of knowledge about how to use simulation-based techniques for statistical inference and how these techniques help build intuition about traditional theory-based inferential methods like the \\(t\\)-test. The hope is that you’ve come to appreciate the power of data in all respects, such as data wrangling, tidying datasets, data visualization, statistical/data modeling, and statistical inference. In our opinion, while each of these is important, data visualization may be the most important tool for a citizen or professional data scientist to have in their toolbox. If you can create truly beautiful graphics that display information in ways that the reader can clearly understand, you have great power to tell your tale with data. Let’s hope that these skills help you tell great stories with data into the future. Thanks for coming along this journey as we dove into modern data analysis using R and the tidyverse! "],["A-appendixA.html", "A Statistical Background A.1 Basic statistical terms A.2 Normal distribution A.3 log10 transformations", " A Statistical Background A.1 Basic statistical terms Note that all the following statistical terms apply only to numerical variables, except the distribution which can exist for both numerical and categorical variables. A.1.1 Mean The mean is the most commonly reported measure of center. It is commonly called the average though this term can be a little ambiguous. The mean is the sum of all of the data elements divided by how many elements there are. If we have \\(n\\) data points, the mean is given by: \\[Mean = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n}\\] A.1.2 Median The median is calculated by first sorting a variable’s data from smallest to largest. After sorting the data, the middle element in the list is the median. If the middle falls between two values, then the median is the mean of those two middle values. A.1.3 Standard deviation and variance We will next discuss the standard deviation (\\(sd\\)) of a variable. The formula can be a little intimidating at first but it is important to remember that it is essentially a measure of how far we expect a given data value will be from its mean: \\[sd = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}}\\] The variance of a variable is merely the standard deviation squared. \\[variance = sd^2 = \\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}\\] A.1.4 Five-number summary The five-number summary consists of five summary statistics: the minimum, the first quantile AKA 25th percentile, the second quantile AKA median or 50th percentile, the third quantile AKA 75th, and the maximum. The five-number summary of a variable is used when constructing boxplots, as seen in Section 2.7. The quantiles are calculated as first quantile (\\(Q_1\\)): the median of the first half of the sorted data third quantile (\\(Q_3\\)): the median of the second half of the sorted data The interquartile range (IQR) is defined as \\(Q_3 - Q_1\\) and is a measure of how spread out the middle 50% of values are. The IQR corresponds to the length of the box in a boxplot. The median and the IQR are not influenced by the presence of outliers in the ways that the mean and standard deviation are. They are, thus, recommended for skewed datasets. We say in this case that the median and IQR are more robust to outliers. A.1.5 Distribution The distribution of a variable shows how frequently different values of a variable occur. Looking at the visualization of a distribution can show where the values are centered, show how the values vary, and give some information about where a typical value might fall. It can also alert you to the presence of outliers. Recall from Chapter 2 that we can visualize the distribution of a numerical variable using binning in a histogram and that we can visualize the distribution of a categorical variable using a barplot. A.1.6 Outliers Outliers correspond to values in the dataset that fall far outside the range of “ordinary” values. In the context of a boxplot, by default they correspond to values below \\(Q_1 - (1.5 \\cdot IQR)\\) or above \\(Q_3 + (1.5 \\cdot IQR)\\). A.2 Normal distribution Let’s next discuss one particular kind of distribution: normal distributions. Such bell-shaped distributions are defined by two values: (1) the mean \\(\\mu\\) (“mu”) which locates the center of the distribution and (2) the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) (“sigma”) which determines the variation of the distribution. In Figure A.1, we plot three normal distributions where: The solid normal curve has mean \\(\\mu = 5\\) &amp; standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 2\\). The dotted normal curve has mean \\(\\mu = 5\\) &amp; standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 5\\). The dashed normal curve has mean \\(\\mu = 15\\) &amp; standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 2\\). FIGURE A.1: Three normal distributions. Notice how the solid and dotted line normal curves have the same center due to their common mean \\(\\mu\\) = 5. However, the dotted line normal curve is wider due to its larger standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\) = 5. On the other hand, the solid and dashed line normal curves have the same variation due to their common standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) = 2. However, they are centered at different locations. When the mean \\(\\mu\\) = 0 and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) = 1, the normal distribution has a special name. It’s called the standard normal distribution or the \\(z\\)-curve. Furthermore, if a variable follows a normal curve, there are three rules of thumb we can use: 68% of values will lie within \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation of the mean. 95% of values will lie within \\(\\pm\\) 1.96 \\(\\approx\\) 2 standard deviations of the mean. 99.7% of values will lie within \\(\\pm\\) 3 standard deviations of the mean. Let’s illustrate this on a standard normal curve in Figure A.2. The dashed lines are at -3, -1.96, -1, 0, 1, 1.96, and 3. These 7 lines cut up the x-axis into 8 segments. The areas under the normal curve for each of the 8 segments are marked and add up to 100%. For example: The middle two segments represent the interval -1 to 1. The shaded area above this interval represents 34% + 34% = 68% of the area under the curve. In other words, 68% of values. The middle four segments represent the interval -1.96 to 1.96. The shaded area above this interval represents 13.5% + 34% + 34% + 13.5% = 95% of the area under the curve. In other words, 95% of values. The middle six segments represent the interval -3 to 3. The shaded area above this interval represents 2.35% + 13.5% + 34% + 34% + 13.5% + 2.35% = 99.7% of the area under the curve. In other words, 99.7% of values. FIGURE A.2: Rules of thumb about areas under normal curves. Learning check Say you have a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu = 6\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 3\\). (LCA.1) What proportion of the area under the normal curve is less than 3? Greater than 12? Between 0 and 12? (LCA.2) What is the 2.5th percentile of the area under the normal curve? The 97.5th percentile? The 100th percentile? A.2.1 Additional normal calculations For a normal density curve, the probabilities or areas for any given interval can be obtained using the R function pnorm(). Think of the p in the name as __p__robability or __p__ercentage as this function finds the area under the curve to the left of any given value which is the probability of observing any number less than or equal to that value. It is possible to indicate the appropriate expected value and standard deviation as arguments in the function, but the default uses the standard normal values, \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1\\). For example, the probability of observing a value that is less than or equal to 1 in the standard normal curve is given by: pnorm(1) [1] 0.841 or 84%. This is the probability of observing a value that is less than or equal to one standard deviation above the mean. It is shown in Figure @ref(fig: normal-curve-shaded-1a) ggplot(NULL, aes(c(-4,4))) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey50&quot;, xlim = c(-4, 1)) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey100&quot;, xlim = c(1, 4)) + labs(x = &quot;z&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1) Similarly, the probability of observing a standard value between -1 and 1 is given by subtracting the area to the left of -1 from the area to the left of 1, as shown in Figure @ref(fig: normal-curve-shaded-2) ggplot(NULL, aes(c(-4,4))) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey100&quot;, xlim = c(-4, -1)) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey80&quot;, xlim = c(-1, 1)) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey100&quot;, xlim = c(1, 4)) + labs(x = &quot;z&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-1,1)) In R, we obtain this probability as follows: pnorm(1) - pnorm(-1) [1] 0.683 The probability of getting a standard value between -1 and 1, or equivalently, the probability of observing a value within one standard deviation from the mean is about 68%. Similarly, the probability of getting a value within 2 standard deviations from the mean is given by pnorm(2) - pnorm(-2) [1] 0.954 or about 95%. Moreover, we do not need to restrict our study to areas within one or two standard deviations from the mean. We can find the number of standard deviations needed for any desired percentage around the mean using the R function qnorm(). The q in the name stands for \\(quantile\\) and this function can be thought of as the inverse or complement of pnorm(). It finds the value of the random variable for a given area under the curve to the left of this value. When using the standard normal, the quantile also represents the number of standard deviations. For example, in Figure ?? we learned that the area under the standard normal curve to the left of a standard value of 1 was approximately 84%. If instead, we want to find the standard value that corresponds to exactly an area of 84% under the curve to the left of this value, we can use the following syntax: qnorm(0.84) [1] 0.994 In other words, there is exactly an 84% chance that the observed standard value is less than or equal to 0.994. Similarly, to have exactly a 95% chance of obtaining a value within q number of standard deviations from the mean, we need to select the appropriate value for qnorm(). ggplot(NULL, aes(c(-4,4))) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey100&quot;, xlim = c(-4, -2)) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey80&quot;, xlim = c(-2, 2)) + geom_area(stat = &quot;function&quot;, fun = dnorm, fill = &quot;grey100&quot;, xlim = c(2, 4)) + labs(x = &quot;z&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) + annotate(geom=&quot;text&quot;, x=2, y=-0.01, label=&quot;q&quot;, color=&quot;blue&quot;) Observe Figure ??. We want to find the standard value q such that the area in the middle is exactly 0.95 (or 95%). Before using qnorm() we need to provide the total area under the curve to the left of q. Since the total area under the normal density curve is 1, the curve is symmetric, and the area in the middle is 0.95, the total area on the tails is 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 (or 5%), and the area on each tail is 0.05/2 = 0.025 (or 2.5%). The total area under the curve to the left of q will be the area in the middle and the area on the left tail or 0.95 + 0.025 = 0.975. We can now obtain the standard value q by using qnorm(): q &lt;- qnorm(0.975) q [1] 1.96 The probability of observing a value within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean is exactly 95%. We can follow this method to obtain the number of standard deviations needed for any area, or probability, around the mean. For example, if we want an area of 98% around the mean, the area on the tails is 1 - 0.98 = 0.02, or 0.02/2 = 0.01 on each tail, the area under the curve to the left of the desired q value would be 0.98 + 0.01 = 0.99 so qnorm(0.99) [1] 2.33 The area within 2.33 standard deviations from the mean is 98%, or there is a 98% chance of choosing a value within 2.33 standard deviations from the mean. This information will be very useful to us. A.3 log10 transformations At its simplest, log10 transformations return base 10 logarithms. For example, since \\(1000 = 10^3\\), running log10(1000) returns 3 in R. To undo a log10 transformation, we raise 10 to this value. For example, to undo the previous log10 transformation and return the original value of 1000, we raise 10 to the power of 3 by running 10^(3) = 1000 in R. Log transformations allow us to focus on changes in orders of magnitude. In other words, they allow us to focus on multiplicative changes instead of additive ones. Let’s illustrate this idea in Table A.1 with examples of prices of consumer goods in 2019 US dollars. TABLE A.1: TABLE A.2: log10 transformed prices, orders of magnitude, and examples Price log10(Price) Order of magnitude Examples $1 0 Singles Cups of coffee $10 1 Tens Books $100 2 Hundreds Mobile phones $1,000 3 Thousands High definition TVs $10,000 4 Tens of thousands Cars $100,000 5 Hundreds of thousands Luxury cars and houses $1,000,000 6 Millions Luxury houses Let’s make some remarks about log10 transformations based on Table A.1: When purchasing a cup of coffee, we tend to think of prices ranging in single dollars, such as $2 or $3. However, when purchasing a mobile phone, we don’t tend to think of their prices in units of single dollars such as $313 or $727. Instead, we tend to think of their prices in units of hundreds of dollars like $300 or $700. Thus, cups of coffee and mobile phones are of different orders of magnitude in price. Let’s say we want to know the log10 transformed value of $76. This would be hard to compute exactly without a calculator. However, since $76 is between $10 and $100 and since log10(10) = 1 and log10(100) = 2, we know log10(76) will be between 1 and 2. In fact, log10(76) is 1.880814. log10 transformations are monotonic, meaning they preserve orders. So if Price A is lower than Price B, then log10(Price A) will also be lower than log10(Price B). Most importantly, increments of one in log10-scale correspond to relative multiplicative changes in the original scale and not absolute additive changes. For example, increasing a log10(Price) from 3 to 4 corresponds to a multiplicative increase by a factor of 10: $100 to $1000.

FIGURE B.1: Mind map for Inference. B.2 One mean B.2.1 Problem statement The National Survey of Family Growth conducted by the Centers for Disease Control gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health. One of the variables collected on this survey is the age at first marriage. 5,534 randomly sampled US women between 2006 and 2010 completed the survey. The women sampled here had been married at least once. Do we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years? (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 4]) B.2.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is equal to 23 years. Alternative hypothesis: The mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_{0}\\), where \\(\\mu\\) represents the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 and \\(\\mu_0\\) is 23. \\(H_A: \\mu &gt; 23\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.2.3 Exploring the sample data age_at_marriage &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/ageAtMar.csv&quot;) age_summ &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% summarize( sample_size = n(), mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age), minimum = min(age), lower_quartile = quantile(age, 0.25), median = median(age), upper_quartile = quantile(age, 0.75), max = max(age) ) kable(age_summ) %&gt;% kable_styling( font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16), latex_options = c(&quot;hold_position&quot;) ) sample_size mean sd minimum lower_quartile median upper_quartile max 5534 23.4 4.72 10 20 23 26 43 The histogram below also shows the distribution of age. ggplot(data = age_at_marriage, mapping = aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, color = &quot;white&quot;) The observed statistic of interest here is the sample mean: x_bar &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) x_bar Response: age (numeric) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 23.4402 Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \\(\\mu_0 = 23\\). They seem to be quite close, but we have a large sample size here. Let’s guess that the large sample size will lead us to reject this practically small difference. B.2.4 Non-traditional methods Bootstrapping for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \\(\\mu_0 = 23\\), we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 5534 was selected. We can use the idea of bootstrapping to simulate the population from which the sample came and then generate samples from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. Recall how bootstrapping would apply in this context: Sample with replacement from our original sample of 5534 women and repeat this process 10,000 times, calculate the mean for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1, combine all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a boot_distn object, and shift the center of this distribution over to the null value of 23. (This is needed since it will be centered at 23.44 via the process of bootstrapping.) set.seed(2018) null_distn_one_mean &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, mu = 23) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a right-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to 23.44 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize() + shade_p_value(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu\\) using our sample data using bootstrapping. Note that we don’t need to shift this distribution since we want the center of our confidence interval to be our point estimate \\(\\bar{x}_{obs} = 23.44\\). boot_distn_one_mean &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) ci &lt;- boot_distn_one_mean %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 23.3148 23.5669 boot_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize() + shade_ci(endpoints = ci) We see that 23 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu\\) (the unknown population mean) and the entire interval is larger than 23. This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (\\(\\mu &gt; 23\\)). Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is between 23.315 and 23.567. B.2.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are collected independently. The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The distribution of the response variable should be normal or the sample size should be at least 30. The histogram for the sample above does show some skew. The Q-Q plot below also shows some skew. ggplot(data = age_at_marriage, mapping = aes(sample = age)) + stat_qq() The sample size here is quite large though (\\(n = 5534\\)) so both conditions are met. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean \\(\\mu\\). A good guess is the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}_{obs} = 23.44\\) or larger assuming that the population mean is 23 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can “standardize” this original test statistic of \\(\\bar{X}\\) into a \\(T\\) statistic that follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 1\\): \\[ T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{ S / \\sqrt{n} } \\sim t (df = n - 1) \\] where \\(S\\) represents the standard deviation of the sample and \\(n\\) is the sample size. Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the t_test() function to perform this analysis for us. t_test_results &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% t_test( formula = age ~ NULL, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, mu = 23 ) t_test_results # A tibble: 1 × 7 statistic t_df p_value alternative estimate lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 6.93570 5533 2.25216e-12 greater 23.4402 23.3358 Inf We see here that the \\(t_{obs}\\) value is 6.936. Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(t_{obs}\\) value of 6.936 or more in our null distribution of a \\(t\\) with 5533 degrees of freedom—is essentially 0. State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean was statistically greater than the hypothesized mean has supporting evidence here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years. Confidence interval t.test( x = age_at_marriage$age, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, mu = 23 )$conf [1] 23.3 23.6 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.95 B.2.6 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met (the large sample size was the driver here) leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.3 One proportion B.3.1 Problem statement The CEO of a large electric utility claims that 80 percent of his 1,000,000 customers are satisfied with the service they receive. To test this claim, the local newspaper surveyed 100 customers, using simple random sampling. 73 were satisfied and the remaining were unsatisfied. Based on these findings from the sample, can we reject the CEO’s hypothesis that 80% of the customers are satisfied? [Tweaked a bit from http://stattrek.com/hypothesis-test/proportion.aspx?Tutorial=AP] B.3.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is equal 0.80. Alternative hypothesis: The proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is different from 0.80. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\pi = p_{0}\\), where \\(\\pi\\) represents the proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive and \\(p_0\\) is 0.8. \\(H_A: \\pi \\ne 0.8\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.3.3 Exploring the sample data elec &lt;- c(rep(&quot;satisfied&quot;, 73), rep(&quot;unsatisfied&quot;, 27)) %&gt;% enframe() %&gt;% rename(satisfy = value) The bar graph below also shows the distribution of satisfy. ggplot(data = elec, aes(x = satisfy)) + geom_bar() The observed statistic is computed as p_hat &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) p_hat Response: satisfy (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.73 Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the sample proportion of 0.73 is statistically different from \\(p_0 = 0.8\\) based on this sample. They seem to be quite close, and our sample size is not huge here (\\(n = 100\\)). Let’s guess that we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis. B.3.4 Non-traditional methods Simulation for hypothesis test In order to look to see if 0.73 is statistically different from 0.8, we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 100 was selected. We can use the idea of an unfair coin to simulate this process. We will simulate flipping an unfair coin (with probability of success 0.8 matching the null hypothesis) 100 times. Then we will keep track of how many heads come up in those 100 flips. Our simulated statistic matches with how we calculated the original statistic \\(\\hat{p}\\): the number of heads (satisfied) out of our total sample of 100. We then repeat this process many times (say 10,000) to create the null distribution looking at the simulated proportions of successes: set.seed(2018) null_distn_one_prop &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, p = 0.8) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are 0.8 - 0.73 = 0.07 away from 0.8 in BOTH directions for our \\(p\\)-value: null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize() + shade_p_value(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.1136 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0.114 and we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\pi\\) using our sample data. To do so, we use bootstrapping, which involves sampling with replacement from our original sample of 100 survey respondents and repeating this process 10,000 times, calculating the proportion of successes for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1, combining all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a boot_distn object, identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of this distribution (corresponding to the 5% significance level chosen) to find a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\pi\\), and interpret this confidence interval in the context of the problem. boot_distn_one_prop &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) Just as we use the mean function for calculating the mean over a numerical variable, we can also use it to compute the proportion of successes for a categorical variable where we specify what we are calling a “success” after the ==. (Think about the formula for calculating a mean and how R handles logical statements such as satisfy == \"satisfied\" for why this must be true.) ci &lt;- boot_distn_one_prop %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.64 0.81 boot_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize() + shade_ci(endpoints = ci) We see that 0.80 is contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\pi\\) (the unknown population proportion). This matches with our hypothesis test results of failing to reject the null hypothesis. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true proportion of customers who are satisfied with the service they receive is between 0.64 and 0.81. B.3.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are collected independently. The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The number of expected successes and expected failures is at least 10. This condition is met since 73 and 27 are both greater than 10. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population proportion \\(\\pi\\). A good guess is the sample proportion \\(\\hat{P}\\). Recall that this sample proportion is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample proportion of \\(\\hat{p}_{obs} = 0.73\\) or more extreme assuming that the population proportion is 0.80 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can standardize this original test statistic of \\(\\hat{P}\\) into a \\(Z\\) statistic that follows a \\(N(0, 1)\\) distribution. \\[ Z =\\dfrac{ \\hat{P} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n} }} \\sim N(0, 1) \\] Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand” by plugging the observed values into the formula, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. The calculation has been done in R below for completeness though: p_hat &lt;- 0.73 p0 &lt;- 0.8 n &lt;- 100 (z_obs &lt;- (p_hat - p0) / sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n)) [1] -1.75 We see here that the \\(z_{obs}\\) value is around -1.75. Our observed sample proportion of 0.73 is 1.75 standard errors below the hypothesized parameter value of 0.8. Visualize and compute \\(p\\)-value elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, p = 0.8) %&gt;% assume(distribution = &quot;z&quot;) %&gt;% visualize() + shade_p_value(obs_stat = z_obs, direction = &quot;both&quot;) 2 * pnorm(z_obs) [1] 0.0801 The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(z_{obs}\\) value of -1.75 or more extreme (in both directions) in our null distribution—is around 8%. Note that we could also do this test directly using the prop.test function. prop.test( x = table(elec$satisfy), n = length(elec$satisfy), alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, p = 0.8, correct = FALSE ) 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction data: table(elec$satisfy), null probability 0.8 X-squared = 3, df = 1, p-value = 0.08 alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.8 95 percent confidence interval: 0.636 0.807 sample estimates: p 0.73 prop.test does a \\(\\chi^2\\) test here but this matches up exactly with what we would expect: \\(x^2_{obs} = 3.06 = (-1.75)^2 = (z_{obs})^2\\) and the \\(p\\)-values are the same because we are focusing on a two-tailed test. Note that the 95 percent confidence interval given above matches well with the one calculated using bootstrapping. State conclusion We, therefore, do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample proportion was not statistically different from the hypothesized proportion has not been invalidated. Based on this sample, we have do not evidence that the proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is different from 0.80, at the 5% level. B.3.6 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.4 Two proportions B.4.1 Problem statement A 2010 survey asked 827 randomly sampled registered voters in California “Do you support? Or do you oppose? Drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California? Or do you not know enough to say?” Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the data provide strong evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do not have an opinion on this issue is different than that of non-college graduates. (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 6]) B.4.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: There is no association between having an opinion on drilling and having a college degree for all registered California voters in 2010. Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between having an opinion on drilling and having a college degree for all registered California voters in 2010. Another way in words Null hypothesis: The probability that a Californian voter in 2010 having no opinion on drilling and is a college graduate is the same as that of a non-college graduate. Alternative hypothesis: These parameter probabilities are different. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\pi_{college} = \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) or \\(H_0: \\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college} = 0\\), where \\(\\pi\\) represents the probability of not having an opinion on drilling. \\(H_A: \\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college} \\ne 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.4.3 Exploring the sample data offshore &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/offshore.csv&quot;) counts &lt;- offshore %&gt;% tabyl(college_grad, response) counts college_grad no opinion opinion no 131 258 yes 104 334 Observe that of the college graduates, a proportion of 104/(104 + 334) = 0.237 have no opinion on drilling. On the other hand, of the non-college graduates, a proportion of 131/(131 + 258) = 0.337 have no opinion on drilling, whereas the difference in these proportions is 0.237 - 0.337 = -0.099. Let’s visualize these in a barchart. However, we first reverse the order of the levels in the categorical variable response using the fct_rev() function from the forcats package. We do this because the default ordering of levels in a factor is alphanumeric. However, we are interested in proportions that have no opinion and not opinion. Thus we need to reverse the default alphanumeric order. offshore &lt;- offshore %&gt;% mutate(response = fct_rev(response)) ggplot(offshore, aes(x = college_grad, fill = response)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;College grad?&quot;, y = &quot;Proportion with no opinion on drilling&quot;) + coord_flip() Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if a difference exists in the size of the bars corresponding to no opinion for the plot. Based solely on the plot, we have little reason to believe that a difference exists since the bars seem to be about the same size, BUT…it’s important to use statistics to see if that difference is actually statistically significant! B.4.4 Non-traditional methods Collecting summary info The observed statistic is d_hat &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) d_hat Response: response (factor) Explanatory: college_grad (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.0993180 Randomization for hypothesis test In order to ascertain if the observed sample proportion with no opinion for college graduates of 0.237 is statistically different than the observed sample proportion with no opinion for non-college graduates of 0.337, we need to account for the sample sizes. Note that this is the same as ascertaining if the observed difference in sample proportions -0.099 is statistically different than 0. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 389 and 438 were selected. We can use the idea of randomization testing (also known as permutation testing) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using shuffling from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. set.seed(2018) null_distn_two_props &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) null_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to 0.099 or less than or equal to -0.099 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize() + shade_p_value(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_two_props %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;two_sided&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0024 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0.002 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the tails of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) using our sample data with bootstrapping. boot_distn_two_props &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) ci &lt;- boot_distn_two_props %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.160030 -0.0379112 boot_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize() + shade_ci(endpoints = ci) We see that 0 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter, we have evidence that the proportion of college graduates in California with no opinion on drilling is different than that of non-college graduates. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true proportion of non-college graduates with no opinion on offshore drilling in California is between 0.16 dollars smaller to 0.04 dollars smaller than for college graduates. B.4.5 Traditional methods B.4.5.1 Check conditions Remember that in order to use the short-cut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: Each case that was selected must be independent of all the other cases selected. This condition is met since cases were selected at random to observe. Sample size: The number of pooled successes and pooled failures must be at least 10 for each group. We need to first figure out the pooled success rate: \\[\\hat{p}_{obs} = \\dfrac{131 + 104}{827} = 0.28.\\] We now determine expected (pooled) success and failure counts: \\(0.28 \\cdot (131 + 258) = 108.92\\), \\(0.72 \\cdot (131 + 258) = 280.08\\) \\(0.28 \\cdot (104 + 334) = 122.64\\), \\(0.72 \\cdot (104 + 334) = 315.36\\) Independent selection of samples: The cases are not paired in any meaningful way. We have no reason to suspect that a college graduate selected would have any relationship to a non-college graduate selected. B.4.6 Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we are interested in seeing if our observed difference in sample proportions corresponding to no opinion on drilling (\\(\\hat{p}_{college, obs} - \\hat{p}_{no\\_college, obs}\\) = -0.092) is statistically different than 0. Assuming that conditions are met and the null hypothesis is true, we can use the standard normal distribution to standardize the difference in sample proportions (\\(\\hat{P}_{college} - \\hat{P}_{no\\_college}\\)) using the standard error of \\(\\hat{P}_{college} - \\hat{P}_{no\\_college}\\) and the pooled estimate: \\[ Z =\\dfrac{ (\\hat{P}_{college} - \\hat{P}_{no_college}) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\hat{P}(1 - \\hat{P})}{n_1} + \\dfrac{\\hat{P}(1 - \\hat{P})}{n_2} }} \\sim N(0, 1) \\] where \\(\\hat{P} = \\dfrac{\\text{total number of successes} }{ \\text{total number of cases}}.\\) Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the prop.test function to perform this analysis for us. z_hat &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;z&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) z_hat Response: response (factor) Explanatory: college_grad (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -3.16081 The observed difference in sample proportions is 3.16 standard deviations smaller than 0. The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing a \\(Z\\) value of -3.16 or more extreme in our null distribution—is 0.0016. This can also be calculated in R directly: 2 * pnorm(-3.16, lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.00158 B.4.7 State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that a statistically significant difference did not exist in the proportions of no opinion on offshore drilling between college educated and non-college educated Californians was not validated. We do have evidence to suggest that there is a dependency between college graduation and position on offshore drilling for Californians. B.4.8 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results. B.5 Two means (independent samples) B.5.1 Problem statement Average income varies from one region of the country to another, and it often reflects both lifestyles and regional living expenses. Suppose a new graduate is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and he wants to see whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other. He would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on two randomly selected samples from the 2000 Census. (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 5]) B.5.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: There is no association between income and location (Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA). Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between income and location (Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA). Another way in words Null hypothesis: The mean income is the same for both cities. Alternative hypothesis: The mean income is different for the two cities. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu_{sac} = \\mu_{cle}\\) or \\(H_0: \\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle} = 0\\), where \\(\\mu\\) represents the average income. \\(H_A: \\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle} \\ne 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.5.3 Exploring the sample data cle_sac &lt;- read.delim(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/cleSac.txt&quot;) %&gt;% rename( metro_area = Metropolitan_area_Detailed, income = Total_personal_income ) %&gt;% na.omit() inc_summ &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% group_by(metro_area) %&gt;% summarize( sample_size = n(), mean = mean(income), sd = sd(income), minimum = min(income), lower_quartile = quantile(income, 0.25), median = median(income), upper_quartile = quantile(income, 0.75), max = max(income) ) kable(inc_summ) %&gt;% kable_styling( font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16), latex_options = c(&quot;hold_position&quot;) ) metro_area sample_size mean sd minimum lower_quartile median upper_quartile max Cleveland_ OH 212 27467 27681 0 8475 21000 35275 152400 Sacramento_ CA 175 32428 35774 0 8050 20000 49350 206900 The boxplot below also shows the mean for each group highlighted by the red dots. ggplot(cle_sac, aes(x = metro_area, y = income)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun = &quot;mean&quot;, geom = &quot;point&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;) Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if a difference exists in the mean income of the two levels of the explanatory variable. Based solely on the boxplot, we have reason to believe that no difference exists. The distributions of income seem similar and the means fall in roughly the same place. B.5.4 Non-traditional methods Collecting summary info We now compute the observed statistic: d_hat &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% calculate( stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;) ) d_hat Response: income (numeric) Explanatory: metro_area (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 4960.48 Randomization for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean for Sacramento of 27467.066 is statistically different than that for Cleveland of 32427.543, we need to account for the sample sizes. Note that this is the same as looking to see if \\(\\bar{x}_{sac} - \\bar{x}_{cle}\\) is statistically different than 0. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 212 and 175 were selected. We can use the idea of randomization testing (also known as permutation testing) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using shuffling from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. set.seed(2018) null_distn_two_means &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate( stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;) ) null_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to 4960.477 or less than or equal to -4960.477 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize() + shade_p_value(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_two_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.1262 So our \\(p\\)-value is 0.126 and we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are not very far into the tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle}\\) using our sample data with bootstrapping. Here we will bootstrap each of the samples with replacement instead of shuffling. This is done by setting the type argument in the generate function to “bootstrap”. boot_distn_two_means &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate( stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;) ) ci &lt;- boot_distn_two_means %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -1359.50 11499.7 boot_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize() + shade_ci(endpoints = ci) We see that 0 is contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of failing to reject the null hypothesis. Since zero is a plausible value of the population parameter, we do not have evidence that Sacramento incomes are different than Cleveland incomes. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean yearly income for those living in Sacramento is between 1359.5 dollars smaller to 11499.69 dollars higher than for Cleveland. Note: You could also use the null distribution based on randomization with a shift to have its center at \\(\\bar{x}_{sac} - \\bar{x}_{cle} = \\$4960.48\\) instead of at 0 and calculate its percentiles. The confidence interval produced via this method should be comparable to the one done using bootstrapping above. B.5.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the short-cut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are independent in both groups. This metro_area variable is met since the cases are randomly selected from each city. Approximately normal: The distribution of the response for each group should be normal or the sample sizes should be at least 30. ggplot(cle_sac, aes(x = income)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, binwidth = 20000) + facet_wrap(~metro_area) We have some reason to doubt the normality assumption here since both the histograms show deviation from a normal model fitting the data well for each group. The sample sizes for each group are greater than 100 though so the assumptions should still apply. Independent samples: The samples should be collected without any natural pairing. There is no mention of there being a relationship between those selected in Cleveland and in Sacramento. B.5.6 Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we are interested in seeing if our observed difference in sample means (\\(\\bar{x}_{sac, obs} - \\bar{x}_{cle, obs}\\) = 4960.477) is statistically different than 0. Assuming that conditions are met and the null hypothesis is true, we can use the \\(t\\) distribution to standardize the difference in sample means (\\(\\bar{X}_{sac} - \\bar{X}_{cle}\\)) using the approximate standard error of \\(\\bar{X}_{sac} - \\bar{X}_{cle}\\) (invoking \\(S_{sac}\\) and \\(S_{cle}\\) as estimates of unknown \\(\\sigma_{sac}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{cle}\\)). \\[ T =\\dfrac{ (\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - 0}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{S_1^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{S_2^2}{n_2}} } \\sim t (df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1)) \\] where 1 = Sacramento and 2 = Cleveland with \\(S_1^2\\) and \\(S_2^2\\) the sample variance of the incomes of both cities, respectively, and \\(n_1 = 175\\) for Sacramento and \\(n_2 = 212\\) for Cleveland. Observed test statistic Note that we could also do (ALMOST) this test directly using the t.test function. The x and y arguments are expected to both be numeric vectors here so we’ll need to appropriately filter our datasets. cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% calculate( stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;, &quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;) ) Response: income (numeric) Explanatory: metro_area (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -1.50062 We see here that the observed test statistic value is around -1.5. While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. B.5.7 Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(t_{174}\\) value of -1.501 or more extreme (in both directions) in our null distribution—is 0.13. This can also be calculated in R directly: 2 * pt(-1.501, df = min(212 - 1, 175 - 1), lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.135 We can also approximate by using the standard normal curve: 2 * pnorm(-1.501) [1] 0.133 B.5.8 State conclusion We, therefore, do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that a statistically significant difference not existing in the means was backed by this statistical analysis. We do not have evidence to suggest that the true mean income differs between Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA based on this data. B.5.9 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.6 Two means (paired samples) Problem statement Trace metals in drinking water affect the flavor and an unusually high concentration can pose a health hazard. Ten pairs of data were taken measuring zinc concentration in bottom water and surface water at 10 randomly selected locations on a stretch of river. Do the data suggest that the true average concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of bottom water? (Note that units are not given.) [Tweaked a bit from Penn State’s STAT 500 course.] B.6.1 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The mean concentration in the bottom water is the same as that of the surface water at different paired locations. Alternative hypothesis: The mean concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of the bottom water at different paired locations. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu_{diff} = 0\\), where \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) represents the mean difference in concentration for surface water minus bottom water. \\(H_A: \\mu_{diff} &lt; 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.6.2 Exploring the sample data zinc_tidy &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://moderndive.com/data/zinc_tidy.csv&quot;) We want to look at the differences in surface - bottom for each location: zinc_diff &lt;- zinc_tidy %&gt;% group_by(loc_id) %&gt;% summarize(pair_diff = diff(concentration)) %&gt;% ungroup() Next we calculate the mean difference as our observed statistic: d_hat &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) d_hat Response: pair_diff (numeric) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.0804 The histogram below also shows the distribution of pair_diff. ggplot(zinc_diff, aes(x = pair_diff)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, color = &quot;white&quot;) Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the sample paired mean difference of -0.08 is statistically less than 0. They seem to be quite close, but we have a small number of pairs here. Let’s guess that we will fail to reject the null hypothesis. B.6.3 Non-traditional methods Bootstrapping for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean difference \\(\\bar{x}_{diff} = -0.08\\) is statistically less than 0, we need to account for the number of pairs. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the paired data was selected in a way similar to how we calculated our original difference in sample means. Treating the differences as our data of interest, we next use the process of bootstrapping to build other simulated samples and then calculate the mean of the bootstrap samples. We hypothesize that the mean difference is zero. This process is similar to comparing the One Mean example seen above, but using the differences between the two groups as a single sample with a hypothesized mean difference of 0. set.seed(2018) null_distn_paired_means &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, mu = 0) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a left-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are less than or equal to -0.08 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize() + shade_p_value(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;less&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;less&quot;) pvalue # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 So our \\(p\\)-value is essentially 0 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the left tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) using our sample data (the calculated differences) with bootstrapping. This is similar to the bootstrapping done in a one sample mean case, except now our data is differences instead of raw numerical data. Note that this code is identical to the pipeline shown in the hypothesis test above except the hypothesize() function is not called. boot_distn_paired_means &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) ci &lt;- boot_distn_paired_means %&gt;% get_ci() ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.1116 -0.0501975 boot_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize() + shade_ci(endpoints = ci) We see that 0 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter and since the entire confidence interval falls below zero, we have evidence that surface zinc concentration levels are lower, on average, than bottom level zinc concentrations. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean zinc concentration on the surface is between 0.11 units smaller to 0.05 units smaller than on the bottom. B.6.4 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations among pairs are independent. The locations are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The distribution of population of differences is normal or the number of pairs is at least 30. The histogram above does show some skew so we have reason to doubt the population being normal based on this sample. We also only have 10 pairs which is fewer than the 30 needed. A theory-based test may not be valid here. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean difference \\(\\mu_{diff}\\). A good guess is the sample mean difference \\(\\bar{X}_{diff}\\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff} = -0.08\\) or smaller assuming that the population mean difference is 0 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can “standardize” this original test statistic of \\(\\bar{X}_{diff}\\) into a \\(T\\) statistic that follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 1\\): \\[ T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{X}_{diff} - 0}{ S_{diff} / \\sqrt{n} } \\sim t (df = n - 1) \\] where \\(S\\) represents the standard deviation of the sample differences and \\(n\\) is the number of pairs. Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the t_test function on the differences to perform this analysis for us. t_test_results &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% t_test( formula = pair_diff ~ NULL, alternative = &quot;less&quot;, mu = 0 ) t_test_results # A tibble: 1 × 7 statistic t_df p_value alternative estimate lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -4.86381 9 0.000445558 less -0.0804 -Inf -0.0500982 We see here that the \\(t_{obs}\\) value is -4.864. Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing a \\(t_{obs}\\) value of -4.864 or less in our null distribution of a \\(t\\) with 9 degrees of freedom—is 0. This can also be calculated in R directly: pt(-4.8638, df = nrow(zinc_diff) - 1, lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.000446 State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean difference was not statistically less than the hypothesized mean of 0 has been invalidated here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean concentration in the bottom water is greater than that of the surface water at different paired locations. B.6.5 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results here.

So the following occurs when computing the median revenue: movies_ex %&gt;% summarize(mean_profit = median(millions)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 mean_profit &lt;dbl&gt; 1 NA You should always think about why a data value might be missing and what that missingness may mean. For example, imagine you are conducting a study on the effects of smoking on lung cancer and a lot of your patients’ data is missing because they died of lung cancer. If you just “sweep these patients under the rug” and ignore them, you are clearly biasing the results. While there are statistical methods to deal with missing data they are beyond the reach of this class. The easiest thing to do is to remove all missing cases, but you should always at the very least report to the reader if you do so, as by removing the missing values you may be biasing your results. You can do this with a na.rm = TRUE argument like so: movies_ex %&gt;% summarize(mean_profit = median(millions, na.rm = TRUE)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 mean_profit &lt;dbl&gt; 1 43.4270 If you decide you want to remove the row with the missing data, you can use the filter function like so: movies_no_missing &lt;- movies_ex %&gt;% filter(!is.na(millions)) movies_no_missing %&gt;% slice(1:10) # A tibble: 10 × 5 name score rating type millions &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 A Guy Thing 39.5 PG-13 rom comedy 15.545 2 A Man Apart 42.9000 R action 26.2480 3 A Mighty Wind 79.9000 PG-13 comedy 17.781 4 Agent Cody Banks 57.9000 PG action 47.8110 5 Alex &amp; Emma 35.1000 PG-13 rom comedy 14.219 6 American Wedding 50.7000 R comedy 104.441 7 Anger Management 62.6000 PG-13 comedy 134.404 8 Anything Else 63.3000 R rom comedy 3.21200 9 Bad Boys II 38.1000 R action 138.397 10 Bad Santa 75.8000 R comedy 59.5230 We see “2 Fast 2 Furious” is now gone. C.1.2 Reordering bars in a barplot Let’s compute the total revenue for each movie type and plot a barplot. revenue_by_type &lt;- movies_ex %&gt;% group_by(type) %&gt;% summarize(total_revenue = sum(millions)) revenue_by_type # A tibble: 6 × 2 type total_revenue &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 action NA 2 animated 561.306 3 comedy 2286.81 4 drama 840.038 5 fantasy 508.580 6 rom comedy 492.282 ggplot(revenue_by_type, aes(x = type, y = total_revenue)) + geom_col() + labs(x = &quot;Movie genre&quot;, y = &quot;Total box office revenue (in millions of $)&quot;) Say we want to reorder the categorical variable type so that the bars show in a different order. We can reorder the bars by manually defining the order of the levels in the factor() command: type_levels &lt;- c(&quot;rom comedy&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;drama&quot;, &quot;animated&quot;, &quot;comedy&quot;, &quot;fantasy&quot;) revenue_by_type &lt;- revenue_by_type %&gt;% mutate(type = factor(type, levels = type_levels)) ggplot(revenue_by_type, aes(x = type, y = total_revenue)) + geom_col() + labs(x = &quot;Movie genre&quot;, y = &quot;Total boxoffice revenue (in millions of $)&quot;) Or if you want to reorder type in ascending order of total_revenue, we use reorder(): revenue_by_type &lt;- revenue_by_type %&gt;% mutate(type = reorder(type, total_revenue)) ggplot(revenue_by_type, aes(x = type, y = total_revenue)) + geom_col() + labs( x = &quot;Movie genre&quot;, y = &quot;Total boxoffice revenue (in millions of $)&quot; ) Or if you want to reorder type in descending order of total_revenue, just put a - sign in front of -total_revenue in reorder(): revenue_by_type &lt;- revenue_by_type %&gt;% mutate(type = reorder(type, -total_revenue)) ggplot(revenue_by_type, aes(x = type, y = total_revenue)) + geom_col() + labs( x = &quot;Movie genre&quot;, y = &quot;Total boxoffice revenue (in millions of $)&quot; ) For more advanced categorical variable (i.e. factor) manipulations, check out the forcats package. Note: forcats is an anagram of factors. C.1.3 Showing money on an axis movies_ex &lt;- movies_ex %&gt;% mutate(revenue = millions * 10^6) ggplot(data = movies_ex, aes(x = rating, y = revenue)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;rating&quot;, y = &quot;Revenue in $&quot;, title = &quot;Profits for different movie ratings&quot;) Google “ggplot2 axis scale dollars” and click on the first link and search for the word “dollars”. You’ll find: # Don&#39;t forget to load the scales package first! library(scales) ggplot(data = movies_ex, aes(x = rating, y = revenue)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;rating&quot;, y = &quot;Revenue in $&quot;, title = &quot;Profits for different movie ratings&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) C.1.4 Changing values inside cells The rename() function in the dplyr package renames column/variable names. To “rename” values inside cells of a particular column, you need to mutate() the column using one of the three functions below. There might be other ones too, but these are the three we’ve seen the most. In these examples, we’ll change values in the variable type. if_else() recode() case_when() if_else() Switch all instances of rom comedy with romantic comedy using if_else() from the dplyr package. If a particular row has type == \"rom comedy\", then return \"romantic comedy\", else return whatever was originally in type. Save everything in a new variable type_new: movies_ex %&gt;% mutate(type_new = if_else(type == &quot;rom comedy&quot;, &quot;romantic comedy&quot;, type)) %&gt;% slice(1:10) # A tibble: 10 × 7 name score rating type millions revenue type_new &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 2 Fast 2 Furious 48.9000 PG-13 action NA NA action 2 A Guy Thing 39.5 PG-13 rom comedy 15.545 15545000 romantic com… 3 A Man Apart 42.9000 R action 26.2480 26247999 action 4 A Mighty Wind 79.9000 PG-13 comedy 17.781 17781000 comedy 5 Agent Cody Banks 57.9000 PG action 47.8110 47811001 action 6 Alex &amp; Emma 35.1000 PG-13 rom comedy 14.219 14219000 romantic com… 7 American Wedding 50.7000 R comedy 104.441 104441000 comedy 8 Anger Management 62.6000 PG-13 comedy 134.404 134404010 comedy 9 Anything Else 63.3000 R rom comedy 3.21200 3212000. romantic com… 10 Bad Boys II 38.1000 R action 138.397 138397000 action Do the same here, but return \"not romantic comedy\" if type is not \"rom comedy\" and this time overwrite the original type variable: movies_ex %&gt;% mutate(type = if_else(type == &quot;rom comedy&quot;, &quot;romantic comedy&quot;, &quot;not romantic comedy&quot;)) %&gt;% slice(1:10) # A tibble: 10 × 6 name score rating type millions revenue &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2 Fast 2 Furious 48.9000 PG-13 not romantic comedy NA NA 2 A Guy Thing 39.5 PG-13 romantic comedy 15.545 15545000 3 A Man Apart 42.9000 R not romantic comedy 26.2480 26247999 4 A Mighty Wind 79.9000 PG-13 not romantic comedy 17.781 17781000 5 Agent Cody Banks 57.9000 PG not romantic comedy 47.8110 47811001 6 Alex &amp; Emma 35.1000 PG-13 romantic comedy 14.219 14219000 7 American Wedding 50.7000 R not romantic comedy 104.441 104441000 8 Anger Management 62.6000 PG-13 not romantic comedy 134.404 134404010 9 Anything Else 63.3000 R romantic comedy 3.21200 3212000. 10 Bad Boys II 38.1000 R not romantic comedy 138.397 138397000 recode() if_else() is rather limited however.

For instance, what if we wanted to have a variable that tells us if a movie made one hundred million dollars or more. That is to say, we can create a binary variable, which is the same thing as a categorical variable with 2 levels. We can again use the mutate() function: movies_ex %&gt;% mutate(big_budget = millions &gt; 100) %&gt;% slice(1:10) # A tibble: 10 × 7 name score rating type millions revenue big_budget &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; 1 2 Fast 2 Furious 48.9000 PG-13 action NA NA NA 2 A Guy Thing 39.5 PG-13 rom comedy 15.545 15545000 FALSE 3 A Man Apart 42.9000 R action 26.2480 26247999 FALSE 4 A Mighty Wind 79.9000 PG-13 comedy 17.781 17781000 FALSE 5 Agent Cody Banks 57.9000 PG action 47.8110 47811001 FALSE 6 Alex &amp; Emma 35.1000 PG-13 rom comedy 14.219 14219000 FALSE 7 American Wedding 50.7000 R comedy 104.441 104441000 TRUE 8 Anger Management 62.6000 PG-13 comedy 134.404 134404010 TRUE 9 Anything Else 63.3000 R rom comedy 3.21200 3212000. FALSE 10 Bad Boys II 38.1000 R action 138.397 138397000 TRUE What if you want to convert a numerical variable into a categorical variable with more than 2 levels? One way is to use the cut() command. For instance, below, we cut() the score variable, to recode it into 4 categories: 0 - 40 = bad 40.1 - 60 = so-so 60.1 - 80 = good 80.1+ = great We set the breaking points for cutting the numerical variable with the c(0, 40, 60, 80, 100) part, and set the labels for each of these bins with the labels = c(\"bad\", \"so-so\", \"good\", \"great\") part. All this action happens inside the mutate() command, so the new categorical variable score_categ is added to the data frame. movies_ex %&gt;% mutate(score_categ = cut(score, breaks = c(0, 40, 60, 80, 100), labels = c(&quot;bad&quot;, &quot;so-so&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;great&quot;) )) %&gt;% slice(1:10) # A tibble: 10 × 7 name score rating type millions revenue score_categ &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 2 Fast 2 Furious 48.9000 PG-13 action NA NA so-so 2 A Guy Thing 39.5 PG-13 rom comedy 15.545 15545000 bad 3 A Man Apart 42.9000 R action 26.2480 26247999 so-so 4 A Mighty Wind 79.9000 PG-13 comedy 17.781 17781000 good 5 Agent Cody Banks 57.9000 PG action 47.8110 47811001 so-so 6 Alex &amp; Emma 35.1000 PG-13 rom comedy 14.219 14219000 bad 7 American Wedding 50.7000 R comedy 104.441 104441000 so-so 8 Anger Management 62.6000 PG-13 comedy 134.404 134404010 good 9 Anything Else 63.3000 R rom comedy 3.21200 3212000. good 10 Bad Boys II 38.1000 R action 138.397 138397000 bad Other options with the cut function: By default, if the value is exactly the upper bound of an interval, it’s included in the lessor category (e.g. 60.0 is ‘so-so’ not ‘good’), to flip this, include the argument right = FALSE. You could also have R equally divide the variable into a balanced number of groups. For example, specifying breaks = 3 would create 3 groups with approximately the same number of values in each group. C.1.6 Computing proportions By using a group_by() followed not by a summarize() as is often the case, but rather a mutate(). So say we compute the total revenue millions for each movie rating and type: rating_by_type_millions &lt;- movies_ex %&gt;% group_by(rating, type) %&gt;% summarize(millions = sum(millions)) %&gt;% arrange(rating, type) rating_by_type_millions # A tibble: 15 × 3 # Groups: rating [4] rating type millions &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 G animated 495.594 2 PG action 47.8110 3 PG animated 65.712 4 PG comedy 829.616 5 PG drama 160.873 6 PG fantasy 147.461 7 PG-13 action NA 8 PG-13 comedy 1208.31 9 PG-13 drama 306.26 10 PG-13 fantasy 361.119 11 PG-13 rom comedy 406.251 12 R action 1044.82 13 R comedy 248.876 14 R drama 372.905 15 R rom comedy 86.0310 Say within each movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R), we want to know the proportion of total_millions that made by each movie type (animated, action, comedy, etc). We can: rating_by_type_millions %&gt;% group_by(rating) %&gt;% mutate( # Compute a new column of the sum of millions split by rating: total_millions = sum(millions), # Compute the proportion within each rating: prop = millions / total_millions ) # A tibble: 15 × 5 # Groups: rating [4] rating type millions total_millions prop &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 G animated 495.594 495.594 1 2 PG action 47.8110 1251.47 0.0382038 3 PG animated 65.712 1251.47 0.0525077 4 PG comedy 829.616 1251.47 0.662912 5 PG drama 160.873 1251.47 0.128547 6 PG fantasy 147.461 1251.47 0.117830 7 PG-13 action NA NA NA 8 PG-13 comedy 1208.31 NA NA 9 PG-13 drama 306.26 NA NA 10 PG-13 fantasy 361.119 NA NA 11 PG-13 rom comedy 406.251 NA NA 12 R action 1044.82 1752.63 0.596143 13 R comedy 248.876 1752.63 0.142001 14 R drama 372.905 1752.63 0.212769 15 R rom comedy 86.0310 1752.63 0.0490868 So for example, the 4 proportions corresponding to R rated movies are 0.596 + 0.142 + 0.213 + 0.0491 = 1. C.1.7 Dealing with %, commas, and $ Say you have numerical data that are recorded as percentages, have commas, or are in dollar form and hence are character strings. How do you convert these to numerical values? Using the parse_number() function from the readr package inside a mutate()! Shout out to Stack Overflow. library(readr) parse_number(&quot;10.5%&quot;) [1] 10.5 parse_number(&quot;145,897&quot;) [1] 145897 parse_number(&quot;$1,234.5&quot;) [1] 1234 What about the other way around? Use the scales package! library(scales) percent(0.105) [1] &quot;10%&quot; comma(145897) [1] &quot;145,897&quot; dollar(1234.5) [1] &quot;$1,234.50&quot; Congratulations. You are now an R Ninja! C.2 Interactive graphics C.2.1 Interactive linegraphs Another useful tool for viewing linegraphs such as this is the dygraph function in the dygraphs package in combination with the dyRangeSelector function. This allows us to zoom in on a selected range and get an interactive plot for us to work with: library(dygraphs) library(nycflights23) flights_day &lt;- mutate(flights, date = as.Date(time_hour)) flights_summarized &lt;- flights_day %&gt;% group_by(date) %&gt;% summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% as.data.frame() rownames(flights_summarized) &lt;- flights_summarized$date flights_summarized &lt;- select(flights_summarized, -date) dyRangeSelector(dygraph(flights_summarized)) The syntax here is a little different than what we have covered so far. The dygraph function is expecting for the dates to be given as the rownames of the object. We convert our data to a data frame (since tibbles don’t allow for easy row name manipulation), and then remove the date variable from the flights_summarized data frame since it is accounted for in the rownames. Lastly, we run the dygraph function on the new data frame that only contains the median arrival delay as a column and then provide the ability to have a selector to zoom in on the interactive plot via dyRangeSelector. (Note that this plot will only be interactive in the HTML version of this book.)
