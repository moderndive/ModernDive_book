This is version 0.3.0.9000 of ModernDive published on July 07, 2018. For previous versions of ModernDive, see Section 1.4. 1.1 Introduction for students This book assumes no prerequisites: no algebra, no calculus, and no prior programming/coding experience. This is intended to be a gentle introduction to the practice of analyzing data and answering questions using data the way data scientists, statisticians, data journalists, and other researchers would. Here is a flowchart of what you’ll cover: We get started with data in Chapter 2: R vs RStudio, coding in R, R packages, and exploring your first real data: all domestic departure flights from a New York City airport in 2013. Then we build up your data science toolbox via the tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. Specifically Chapter 3 on data visualization via the ggplot2 package Chapter 4 on the “tidy” data format Chapter 5 on data wrangling via the dplyr package. Equipped with your new data science toolbox, in Chapters 6 and 7 we’ll make your first forays into data modeling using one of the most commonly-used and easy to understand approaches: linear regression. We’ll use regression as a descriptive tool for now and leverage the moderndive package to help digest the results. We then proceed to cover topics related to statistical inference, the bread and butter of statistics. To this end, we’ll leverage a new package for tidyverse-friendly inference called infer. In particular: Chapter 8 on sampling theory Chapter ?? on confidence intervals (Under construction) Chapter ?? on hypothesis testing (Under construction) (Under construction) After studying simple instances of statistical inference, we revisit the data modeling topics from Chapters 6 and 7 and boost your abilities to interpret the results of regression in Chapter 11 on inference for regression. (Under construction) We’ll end with a discussion on what it means to “think with data” in Chapter 12. 1.1.1 What you will learn from this book We hope that by the end of this book, you’ll have learned How to use R to explore data. How to answer statistical questions using tools like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. How to effectively create “data stories” using these tools. What do we mean by data stories? We mean any analysis involving data that engages the reader in answering questions with careful visuals and thoughtful discussion, such as How strong is the relationship between per capita income and crime in Chicago neighborhoods? and How many f**ks does Quentin Tarantino give (as measured by the amount of swearing in his films)?. Further discussions on data stories can be found in this Think With Google article. For other examples of data stories constructed by students like yourselves, look at the final projects for two courses that have previously used ModernDive: Middlebury College MATH 116 Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences using student collected data. Pacific University SOC 301 Social Statistics using data from the fivethirtyeight R package. This book will help you develop your “data science toolbox”, including tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression. With these tools, you’ll be able to perform the entirety of the “data/science pipeline” while building data communication skills (see Subsection 1.1.2 for more details). In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization. In today’s world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas. We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are to convey relationships with data. You’ll also see the use of visualization to introduce concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, distributions, etc. In general, we’ll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book. To impart the statistical lessons in this book, we have intentionally minimized the number of mathematical formulas used and instead have focused on developing a conceptual understanding via data visualization, statistical computing, and simulations. We hope this is a more intuitive experience than the way statistics has traditionally been taught in the past and how it is commonly perceived. Finally, you’ll learn the importance of literate programming. By this we mean you’ll learn how to write code that is useful not just for a computer to execute but also for readers to understand exactly what your analysis is doing and how you did it. This is part of a greater effort to encourage reproducible research (see Subsection 1.1.3 for more details). Hal Abelson coined the phrase that we will follow throughout this book: “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” We understand that there may be challenging moments as you learn to program. Both of us continue to struggle and find ourselves often using web searches to find answers and reach out to colleagues for help. In the long run though, we all can solve problems faster and more elegantly via programming. We wrote this book as our way to help you get started and you should know that there is a huge community of R users that are always happy to help everyone along as well. This community exists in particular on the internet on various forums and websites such as stackoverflow.com. 1.1.2 Data/science pipeline You may think of statistics as just being a bunch of numbers. We commonly hear the phrase “statistician” when listening to broadcasts of sporting events. Statistics (in particular, data analysis), in addition to describing numbers like with baseball batting averages, plays a vital role in all of the sciences. You’ll commonly hear the phrase “statistically significant” thrown around in the media. You’ll see articles that say “Science now shows that chocolate is good for you.” Underpinning these claims is data analysis. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to better understand whether these claims should be trusted or whether we should be wary. Inside data analysis are many sub-fields that we will discuss throughout this book (though not necessarily in this order): data collection data wrangling data visualization data modeling inference correlation and regression interpretation of results data communication/storytelling These sub-fields are summarized in what Grolemund and Wickham term the “data/science pipeline” in Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1: Data/Science Pipeline We will begin by digging into the gray Understand portion of the cycle with data visualization, then with a discussion on what is meant by tidy data and data wrangling, and then conclude by talking about interpreting and discussing the results of our models via Communication. These steps are vital to any statistical analysis. But why should you care about statistics? “Why did they make me take this class?” There’s a reason so many fields require a statistics course. Scientific knowledge grows through an understanding of statistical significance and data analysis. You needn’t be intimidated by statistics. It’s not the beast that it used to be and, paired with computation, you’ll see how reproducible research in the sciences particularly increases scientific knowledge. 1.1.3 Reproducible research “The most important tool is the mindset, when starting, that the end product will be reproducible.” – Keith Baggerly Another goal of this book is to help readers understand the importance of reproducible analyses. The hope is to get readers into the habit of making their analyses reproducible from the very beginning. This means we’ll be trying to help you build new habits. This will take practice and be difficult at times. You’ll see just why it is so important for you to keep track of your code and well-document it to help yourself later and any potential collaborators as well. Copying and pasting results from one program into a word processor is not the way that efficient and effective scientific research is conducted. It’s much more important for time to be spent on data collection and data analysis and not on copying and pasting plots back and forth across a variety of programs. In a traditional analyses if an error was made with the original data, we’d need to step through the entire process again: recreate the plots and copy and paste all of the new plots and our statistical analysis into your document. This is error prone and a frustrating use of time. We’ll see how to use R Markdown to get away from this tedious activity so that we can spend more time doing science. “We are talking about computational reproducibility.” - Yihui Xie Reproducibility means a lot of things in terms of different scientific fields. Are experiments conducted in a way that another researcher could follow the steps and get similar results? In this book, we will focus on what is known as computational reproducibility. This refers to being able to pass all of one’s data analysis, data-sets, and conclusions to someone else and have them get exactly the same results on their machine. This allows for time to be spent interpreting results and considering assumptions instead of the more error prone way of starting from scratch or following a list of steps that may be different from machine to machine. 1.1.4 Final note for students At this point, if you are interested in instructor perspectives on this book, ways to contribute and collaborate, or the technical details of this book’s construction and publishing, then continue with the rest of the chapter below. Otherwise, let’s get started with R and RStudio in Chapter 2! 1.2 Introduction for instructors This book is inspired by the following books: “Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R” (Chihara and Hesterberg 2011), “OpenIntro: Intro Stat with Randomization and Simulation” (Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014), and “R for Data Science” (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). The first book, while designed for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, provides an excellent resource on how to use resampling to impart statistical concepts like sampling distributions using computation instead of large-sample approximations and other mathematical formulas. The last two books are free options to learning introductory statistics and data science, providing an alternative to the many traditionally expensive introductory statistics textbooks. When looking over the large number of introductory statistics textbooks that currently exist, we found that there wasn’t one that incorporated many newly developed R packages directly into the text, in particular the many packages included in the tidyverse collection of packages, such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and broom. Additionally, there wasn’t an open-source and easily reproducible textbook available that exposed new learners all of three of the learning goals listed at the outset of Subsection 1.1.1. 1.2.1 Who is this book for? This book is intended for instructors of traditional introductory statistics classes using RStudio, either the desktop or server version, who would like to inject more data science topics into their syllabus. We assume that students taking the class will have no prior algebra, calculus, nor programming/coding experience. Here are some principles and beliefs we kept in mind while writing this text. If you agree with them, this might be the book for you. Blur the lines between lecture and lab With increased availability and accessibility of laptops and open-source non-proprietary statistical software, the strict dichotomy between lab and lecture can be loosened. It’s much harder for students to understand the importance of using software if they only use it once a week or less. They forget the syntax in much the same way someone learning a foreign language forgets the rules. Frequent reinforcement is key. Focus on the entire data/science research pipeline We believe that the entirety of Grolemund and Wickham’s data/science pipeline should be taught. We believe in “minimizing prerequisites to research”: students should be answering questions with data as soon as possible. It’s all about the data We leverage R packages for rich, real, and realistic data-sets that at the same time are easy-to-load into R, such as the nycflights13 and fivethirtyeight packages. We believe that data visualization is a gateway drug for statistics and that the Grammar of Graphics as implemented in the ggplot2 package is the best way to impart such lessons. However, we often hear: “You can’t teach ggplot2 for data visualization in intro stats!” We, like David Robinson, are much more optimistic. dplyr has made data wrangling much more accessible to novices, and hence much more interesting data-sets can be explored. Use simulation/resampling to introduce statistical inference, not probability/mathematical formulas Instead of using formulas, large-sample approximations, and probability tables, we teach statistical concepts using resampling-based inference. This allows for a de-emphasis of traditional probability topics, freeing up room in the syllabus for other topics. Don’t fence off students from the computation pool, throw them in! Computing skills are essential to working with data in the 21st century. Given this fact, we feel that to shield students from computing is to ultimately do them a disservice. We are not teaching a course on coding/programming per se, but rather just enough of the computational and algorithmic thinking necessary for data analysis. Complete reproducibility and customizability We are frustrated when textbooks give examples, but not the source code and the data itself. We give you the source code for all examples as well as the whole book! Ultimately the best textbook is one you’ve written yourself. You know best your audience, their background, and their priorities. You know best your own style and the types of examples and problems you like best. Customization is the ultimate end.

This package simplifies the publishing of books by having all content written in R Markdown. The bookdown/R Markdown source code for all versions of ModernDive is available on GitHub: Latest published version The most up-to-date release: Version 0.3.0 released on February 3, 2018 (source code). Available at ModernDive.com Development version The working copy of the next version which is currently being edited: Preview of development version is available at http://moderndive.netlify.com/ Source code: Available on ModernDive’s GitHub repository page Previous versions Older versions that may be out of date: Version 0.2.0 released on August 02, 2017 (source code) Version 0.1.3 released on February 09, 2017 (source code) Version 0.1.2 released on January 22, 2017 (source code) Could this be a new paradigm for textbooks? Instead of the traditional model of textbook companies publishing updated editions of the textbook every few years, we apply a software design influenced model of publishing more easily updated versions. We can then leverage open-source communities of instructors and developers for ideas, tools, resources, and feedback. As such, we welcome your pull requests.

["2-getting-started.html", "2 Getting Started with Data in R 2.1 What are R and RStudio? 2.2 How do I code in R? 2.3 What are R packages? 2.4 Explore your first dataset 2.5 Conclusion", " 2 Getting Started with Data in R Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first: What are R and RStudio? How do I code in R? What are R packages? If you are already familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to Section 2.4 below introducing some of the datasets we will explore in depth in this book. Much of this chapter is based on two sources which you should feel free to use as references if you are looking for additional details: Ismay’s Getting used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown (Ismay 2016), which includes video screen recordings that you can follow along and pause as you learn. DataCamp’s online tutorials. DataCamp is a browser-based interactive platform for learning data science and their tutorials will help facilitate your learning of the above concepts (and other topics in this book). Go to DataCamp and create an account before continuing. 2.1 What are R and RStudio? For much of this book, we will assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest: R is like a car’s engine RStudio is like a car’s dashboard R: Engine RStudio: Dashboard More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well. Optional: For a more in-depth discussion on the difference between R and RStudio IDE, watch this DataCamp video (2m52s). 2.1.1 Installing R and RStudio If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server, then you can skip this section. We do recommend though after a few months of working on the RStudio Server that you return to these instructions. If you don’t know what RStudio Server is, then please read this section. You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. Download and install R. Note: You must do this first. Click on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system. Download and install RStudio. Scroll down to “Installers for Supported Platforms” Click on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system. Optional: If you need more detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio, watch this DataCamp video (1m22s). 2.1.2 Using R via RStudio Recall our car analogy from above. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by using elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs AKA applications you can open. We will always work in RStudio and not R. In other words: R: Do not open this RStudio: Open this After you open RStudio, you should see the following: Watch the following DataCamp video (4m10s) to learn about the different panes in RStudio, in particular the Console pane where you will later run R code. 2.2 How do I code in R? Now that you’re set up with R and RStudio, you are probably asking yourself “OK. Now how do I use R?” The first thing to note as that unlike other software like Excel, STATA, or SAS that provide point and click interfaces, R is an interpreted language, meaning you have to enter in R commands written in R code i.e. you have to program in R (we use the terms “coding” and “programming” interchangeably in this book). While it is not required to be a seasoned coder/computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that R users need to understand. Consequently, while this book is not a book on programming, you will still learn just enough of these basic programming concepts needed to explore and analyze data effectively. 2.2.1 Basic programming concepts and terminology To introduce you to many of these basic programming concepts and terminology, we direct you to the following DataCamp online interactive tutorials. For each of the tutorials, we give a list of the basic programming concepts covered. Note that in this book, we will use a different font to distinguish regular font from computer_code. It is important to note that while these tutorials serve as excellent introductions, a single pass through them is insufficient for long-term learning and retention. The ultimate tools for long-term learning and retention are “learning by doing” and repetition, something we will have you do over the course of the entire book and we encourage this process as much as possible as you learn any new skill. From the Introduction to R course complete the following chapters. As you work through the chapters, carefully note the important terms and what they are used for. We recommend you do so in a notebook that you can easily refer back to. Chapter 1 Intro to basics: Console pane: where you enter in commands Objects: where values are saved, how to assign values to objects. Data types: integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, characters. Chapter 2 Vectors: Vectors: a series of values. Chapter 4 Factors: Categorical data (as opposed to numerical data) are represented in R as factors. Chapter 5 Data frames: Data frames are analogous to rectangular spreadsheets: they are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations. We will revisit this later in Section 2.4. From the Intermediate R course complete the following chapters: Chapter 1 Conditionals and Control Flow: Testing for equality in R using == (and not = which is typically used for assignment). Ex: 2 + 1 == 3 compares 2 + 1 to 3 and is correct R syntax, while 2 + 1 = 3 is not and is incorrect R syntax. Boolean algebra: TRUE/FALSE statements and mathematical operators such as &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), and != (not equal to). Logical operators: &amp; representing “and”, | representing “or”. Ex: (2 + 1 == 3) &amp; (2 + 1 == 4) returns FALSE while (2 + 1 == 3) | (2 + 1 == 4) returns TRUE. Chapter 3 Functions: Concept of functions: they take in inputs (called arguments) and return outputs. You either manually specify a function’s arguments or use the function’s defaults. This list is by no means an exhaustive list of all the programming concepts and terminology needed to become a savvy R user; such a list would be so large it wouldn’t be very useful, especially for novices. Rather, we feel this is the bare minimum you need to know before you get started; the rest we feel you can learn as you go. Remember that your knowledge of all of these concepts will build as you get better and better at “speaking R” and getting used to its syntax. 2.2.2 Tips on learning to code Learning to code/program is very much like learning a foreign language, it can be very daunting and frustrating at first. However just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn. Lastly, there are a few useful things to keep in mind as you learn to program: Computers are stupid: You have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore, your instructions can’t have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way. Take the “copy/paste/tweak” approach: Especially when learning your first programming language, it is often much easier to taking existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends, rather than trying to write new code from scratch. We call this the copy/paste/tweak approach. So early on, we suggest not trying to code from scratch, but please take the code we provide throughout this book and play around with it! Practice is key: Just as the only solution to improving your foreign language skills is practice, so also the only way to get better at R is through pracitice. Don’t worry however, we’ll give you plenty of opportunities to practice! 2.3 What are R packages? Another point of confusion with new R users is the notion of a package. R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation and can be downloaded for free from the internet. They are written by a world-wide community of R users. For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are the ggplot2 package for data visualization in Chapter 3 dplyr package for data wrangling in Chapter 5 There are two key things to remember about R packages: Installation: Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. You need to install a package before you can use it. Once you’ve installed it, you likely don’t need to install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version of the package. Loading: Packages are not loaded automatically when you open RStudio. You need to load them everytime you open RStudio using the library() command. A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone: R: A new phone R Packages: Apps you can download So, expanding on this analogy a bit: R is like a new mobile phone. It has a certain amount of functionality when you use it for the first time, but it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone, much like those offered in the App Store and Google Play. For example: Instagram. In order to use a package, just like in order to use Instagram, you must: First download it and install it. You do this only once. Load it, or in other words, “open” it, using the library() command. So just as you can only start sharing photos with your friends on Instagram if you first install the app and then open it, you can only access an R package’s data and functions if you first install the package and then load it with the library() command. Let’s cover these two steps: 2.3.1 Package installation (Note that if you are working on an RStudio Server, you probably will not need to install your own packages as that has been already done for you. Still it is important that you know this process for later when you are not using the RStudio Server but rather your own installation of RStudio Desktop.) There are two ways to install an R package. For example, to install the ggplot2 package: Easy way: In the Files pane of RStudio: Click on the “Packages” tab Click on “Install” Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type ggplot2 Click “Install” Alternative way: In the Console pane run install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) (you must include the quotation marks). Repeat this for the dplyr and nycflights13 packages. Note: You only have to install a package once, unless you want to update an already installed package to the latest version. If you want to update a package to the latest version, then re-install it by repeating the above steps. 2.3.2 Package loading After you’ve installed a package, you can now load it using the library() command. For example, to load the ggplot2 and dplyr packages, run the following code in the Console pane: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) Note: You have to reload each package you want to use every time you open a new session of RStudio. This is a little annoying to get used to and will be your most common error as you begin. When you see an error such as Error: could not find function remember that this likely comes from you trying to use a function in a package that has not been loaded. Remember to run the library() function with the appropriate package to fix this error. 2.4 Explore your first dataset Let’s put everything we’ve learned so far into practice and start exploring some real data! Data comes to us in a variety of formats, from pictures to text to numbers. Throughout this book, we’ll focus on datasets that can be stored in a spreadsheet as that is among the most common way data is collected in the many fields. Remember from Subsection 2.2.1 that these “spreadsheet”-type datasets are called data frames in R and we will focus on working with data frames throughout this book. Let’s first load all the packages needed for this chapter (This assumes you’ve already installed them. Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages if you haven’t already.) At the beginning of all subsequent chapters in this text, we’ll always have a list of packages similar to what follows that you should have installed and loaded to work with that chapter’s R code. library(dplyr) # Be sure to install these first! library(nycflights13) library(knitr) 2.4.1 nycflights13 package We likely have all flown on airplanes or know someone who has. Air travel has become an ever-present aspect in many people’s lives. If you live in or are visiting a relatively large city and you walk around that city’s airport, you see gates showing flight information from many different airlines. And you will frequently see that some flights are delayed because of a variety of conditions. Are there ways that we can avoid having to deal with these flight delays? We’d all like to arrive at our destinations on time whenever possible. (Unless you secretly love hanging out at airports. If you are one of these people, pretend for the moment that you are very much anticipating being at your final destination.) Throughout this book, we’re going to analyze data related to flights contained in the nycflights13 package (Wickham 2017). Specifically, this package contains five datasets saved as “data frames” (see Section 2.2) with information about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013, from either Newark Liberty International (EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), or LaGuardia (LGA) airports: flights: information on all 336,776 flights airlines: translation between two letter IATA carrier codes and names (16 in total) planes: construction information about each of 3,322 planes used weather: hourly meteorological data (about 8710 observations) for each of the three NYC airports airports: airport names and locations 2.4.2 flights data frame We will begin by exploring the flights data frame that is included in the nycflights13 package and getting an idea of its structure. Run the following in your code in your console: it loads in the flights dataset into your Console. Note depending on the size of your monitor, the output may vary slightly. flights Let’s unpack this output: A tibble: 336,776 x 19: a tibble is a kind of data frame. This particular data frame has 336,776 rows 19 columns corresponding to 19 variables describing each observation year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time are different columns, in other words variables, of this data frame. We then have the first 10 rows of observations corresponding to 10 flights. ... with 336,766 more rows, and 11 more variables: indicating to us that 336,766 more rows of data and 11 more variables could not fit in this screen. Unfortunately, this output does not allow us to explore the data very well. Let’s look at different tools to explore data frames. 2.4.3 Exploring data frames Among the many ways of getting a feel for the data contained in a data frame such as flights, we present three functions that take as their argument the data frame in question: Using the View() function built for use in RStudio. We will use this the most. Using the glimpse() function loaded via dplyr package Using the kable() function in the knitr package Using the $ operator to view a single variable in a data frame 1. View(): Run View(flights) in your Console in RStudio and explore this data frame in the resulting pop-up viewer. You should get into the habit of always Viewing any data frames that come your way. Note the capital “V” in View. R is case-sensitive so you’ll receive an error is you run view(flights) instead of View(flights). Learning check (LC2.1) What does any ONE row in this flights dataset refer to? A. Data on an airline B. Data on a flight C. Data on an airport D. Data on multiple flights Learning Check Solutions (LC2.1) What does any ONE row in this flights dataset refer to? This is data on a flight. Not a flight path! Example: a flight path would be United 1545 to Houston a flight would be United 1545 to Houston 2013/1/1 at 5:15am By running View(flights), we see the different variables listed in the columns and we see that there are different types of variables. Some of the variables like distance, day, and arr_delay are what we will call quantitative variables. These variables are numerical in nature. Other variables here are categorical. Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the View(flights) output, you will see a column of numbers. These are the row numbers of the dataset. If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row corresponds to. In other words, this will allow you to identify what object is being referred to in a given row. This is often called the observational unit. The observational unit in this example is an individual flight departing New York City in 2013. You can identify the observational unit by determining what the thing is that is being measured in each of the variables. 2. glimpse(): The second way to explore a data frame is using the glimpse() function that you can access after you’ve loaded the dplyr package. It provides us with much of the above information and more. glimpse(flights) Observations: 336,776 Variables: 19 $ year &lt;int&gt; 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013... $ month &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... $ day &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... $ dep_time &lt;int&gt; 517, 533, 542, 544, 554, 554, 555, 557, 557, 558, 55... $ sched_dep_time &lt;int&gt; 515, 529, 540, 545, 600, 558, 600, 600, 600, 600, 60... $ dep_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 4, 2, -1, -6, -4, -5, -3, -3, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2,... $ arr_time &lt;int&gt; 830, 850, 923, 1004, 812, 740, 913, 709, 838, 753, 8... $ sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt; 819, 830, 850, 1022, 837, 728, 854, 723, 846, 745, 8... $ arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 20, 33, -18, -25, 12, 19, -14, -8, 8, -2, -3, 7,... $ carrier &lt;chr&gt; &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;DL&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;EV&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;... $ flight &lt;int&gt; 1545, 1714, 1141, 725, 461, 1696, 507, 5708, 79, 301... $ tailnum &lt;chr&gt; &quot;N14228&quot;, &quot;N24211&quot;, &quot;N619AA&quot;, &quot;N804JB&quot;, &quot;N668DN&quot;, &quot;N... $ origin &lt;chr&gt; &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;LGA&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;LGA&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;LG... $ dest &lt;chr&gt; &quot;IAH&quot;, &quot;IAH&quot;, &quot;MIA&quot;, &quot;BQN&quot;, &quot;ATL&quot;, &quot;ORD&quot;, &quot;FLL&quot;, &quot;IA... $ air_time &lt;dbl&gt; 227, 227, 160, 183, 116, 150, 158, 53, 140, 138, 149... $ distance &lt;dbl&gt; 1400, 1416, 1089, 1576, 762, 719, 1065, 229, 944, 73... $ hour &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6... $ minute &lt;dbl&gt; 15, 29, 40, 45, 0, 58, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 59... $ time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; 2013-01-01 05:00:00, 2013-01-01 05:00:00, 2013-01-0... Learning check (LC2.2) What are some examples in this dataset of categorical variables? What makes them different than quantitative variables? (LC2.3) What does int, dbl, and chr mean in the output above? Learning Check Solutions (LC2.2) What are some examples in this dataset of categorical variables? What makes them different than quantitative variables? Hint: Type ?flights in the console to see what all the variables mean! Categorical: carrier the company dest the destination flight the flight number. Even though this is a number, its simply a label. Example United 1545 is not less than United 1714 Quantitative: distance the distance in miles time_hour time (LC2.3) What does int, dbl, and chr mean in the output above? int: integer. Used to count things i.e. a discrete value. Ex: the # of cars parked in a lot dbl: double. Used to measure things. i.e. a continuous value. Ex: your height in inches chr: character. i.e. text We see that glimpse will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable. In addition, the data type (See Subsection 2.2.1) of the variable is given immediately after each variable’s name inside &lt; &gt;. Here, int and num refer to quantitative variables. In contrast, chr refers to categorical variables. One more type of variable is given here with the time_hour variable: dttm. As you may suspect, this variable corresponds to a specific date and time of day. 3. kable(): The final way to explore the entirety of a data frame is using the kable() function from the knitr package. Let’s explore the different carrier codes for all the airlines in our dataset two ways. Run both of these in your Console: airlines kable(airlines) At first glance of both outputs, it may not appear that there is much difference. However, we’ll see later on, especially when using a tool for document production called R Markdown, that the latter produces output that is much more legible. 4. $ operator Lastly, the $ operator allows us to explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console airlines airlines$name We used the $ operator to extract only the name variable and return it as a vector of length 16. We will only be occasionally exploring data frames using this operator. 2.4.4 Help files Another nice feature of R is the help system. You can get help in R by entering a ? before the name of a function or data frame in question and you will be presented with a page showing the documentation. For example, let’s look at the help file for the flights data frame: ?flights A help file should pop-up in the Help pane of RStudio. Note the content of this particular help file is also accessible on the web on page 3 of the PDF document. You should get in the habit of consulting the help file of any function or data frame in R about which you have questions. 2.5 Conclusion We’ve given you what we feel are the most essential concepts to know before you can start exploring data in R. Is this chapter exhaustive? Absolutely not. To try to include everything in this chapter would make the chapter so large it wouldn’t be useful! However, as we stated earlier, the best way to learn R is to learn by doing. Now let’s get into learning about how to create good stories about and with data. In Chapter 3, we start with what we feel is the most important tool in a data scientist’s toolbox: data visualization. 2.5.1 What’s to come? We’ll now start the “data science” portion of the in Chapter 3, where we will further explore the datasets include the nycflights13 package. We’ll see that data visualization is a powerful tool to add to our toolbox for exploring what is going on in a dataset beyond the View and glimpse functions we introduced in this chapter. "],

By visualizing our data, we will be able to gain valuable insights from our data that we couldn’t initially see from just looking at the raw data in spreadsheet form. We will use the ggplot2 package as it provides an easy way to customize your plots and is rooted in the data visualization theory known as The Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005). At the most basic level, graphics/plots/charts (we use these terms interchangeably in this book) provide a nice way for us to get a sense for how quantitative variables compare in terms of their center (where the values tend to be located) and their spread (how they vary around the center). The most important thing to know about graphics is that they should be created to make it obvious for your audience to understand the findings and insight you want to get across. This does however require a balancing act. On the one hand, you want to highlight as many meaningful relationships and interesting findings as possible, but on the other you don’t want to include so many as to overwhelm your audience. As we will see, plots/graphics also help us to identify patterns and outliers in our data. We will see that a common extension of these ideas is to compare the distribution of one quantitative variable (i.e., what the spread of a variable looks like or how the variable is distributed in terms of its values) as we go across the levels of a different categorical variable. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(nycflights13) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) 3.1 The Grammar of Graphics We begin with a discussion of a theoretical framework for data visualization known as the “The Grammar of Graphics,” which serves as the basis for the ggplot2 package. Much like how we construct sentences in any language by using a linguistic grammar (nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, etc.), the theoretical framework given by Leland Wilkinson (Wilkinson 2005) allows us to specify the components of a statistical graphic. 3.1.1 Components of the Grammar In short, the grammar tells us that: A statistical graphic is a mapping of data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects. Specifically, we can break a graphic into the following three essential components: data: the data-set comprised of variables that we map. geom: the geometric object in question. This refers to our type of objects we can observe in our plot. For example, points, lines, bars, etc. aes: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object that we can perceive on a graphic. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Each assigned aesthetic attribute can be mapped to a variable in our data-set. Let’s break down the grammar with an example. 3.1.2 Gapminder In February 2006, a statistician named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled “The best stats you’ve ever seen” where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website gapminder.org. For example, from the 1704 countries included from 2007, consider only the first 6 countries when listed alphabetically: Table 3.1: Gapminder 2007 Data: First 6 of 142 countries Country Continent Life Expectancy Population GDP per Capita Afghanistan Asia 43.83 31889923 974.58 Albania Europe 76.42 3600523 5937.03 Algeria Africa 72.30 33333216 6223.37 Angola Africa 42.73 12420476 4797.23 Argentina Americas 75.32 40301927 12779.38 Australia Oceania 81.23 20434176 34435.37 Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns: Country: Name of country. Continent: Which of the five continents the country is part of. (Note that Americas groups North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded here.) Life Expectancy: Life expectancy in years. Population: Number of people living in the country. GDP per Capita: Gross domestic product (in US dollars). Now consider Figure 3.1, which plots this data for all 142 countries in the data frame. Note that R will deal with large numbers using scientific notation. So in the legend for “Population”, 1.25e+09 = \\(1.25 \\times 10^{9}\\) = 1,250,000,000 = 1.25 billion. Figure 3.1: Life Expectancy over GDP per Capita in 2007 Let’s view this plot through the grammar of graphics: The data variable GDP per Capita gets mapped to the x-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Life Expectancy gets mapped to the y-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Population gets mapped to the size aesthetic of the points. The data variable Continent gets mapped to the color aesthetic of the points. Recall that data here corresponds to each of the variables being in the same data frame and the “data variable” corresponds to a column in a data frame. While in this example we are considering one type of geometric object (of type point), graphics are not limited to just points. Some plots involve lines while others involve bars. Let’s summarize the three essential components of the grammar in a table: Table 3.2: Summary of Grammar of Graphics for this plot data variable aes geom GDP per Capita x point Life Expectancy y point Population size point Continent color point 3.1.3 Other components of the Grammar There are other components of the Grammar of Graphics we can control. As you start to delve deeper into the Grammar of Graphics, you’ll start to encounter these topics more and more often. In this book, we’ll only work with the two other components below (The other components are left to a more advanced text such as R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2016)): faceting breaks up a plot into small multiples corresponding to the levels of another variable (Section 3.6) position adjustments for barplots (Section 3.8) In general, the Grammar of Graphics allows for a high degree of customization and also a consistent framework for easy updating/modification of plots. 3.1.4 The ggplot2 package In this book, we will be using the ggplot2 package for data visualization, which is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics for R (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2018). You may have noticed that a lot of the previous text in this chapter is written in computer font. This is because the various components of the Grammar of Graphics are specified in the ggplot function, which expects at a bare minimum as arguments: The data frame where the variables exist: the data argument The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the mapping argument, which specifies the aesthetic attributes involved After we’ve specified these components, we then add layers to the plot using the + sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the specification of which type of geometric object we want the plot to involve; e.g. points, lines, bars. Other layers we can add include the specification of the plot title, axes labels, facets, and visual themes for the plot. Let’s now put the theory of the Grammar of Graphics into practice. 3.2 Five Named Graphs - The 5NG For our purposes, we will be limiting consideration to five different types of graphs. We term these five named graphs the 5NG: scatterplots linegraphs boxplots histograms barplots We will discuss some variations of these plots, but with this basic repertoire in your toolbox you can visualize a wide array of different data variable types. Note that certain plots are only appropriate for categorical/logical variables and others only for quantitative variables. You’ll want to quiz yourself often as we go along on which plot makes sense a given a particular problem or data-set. 3.3 5NG#1: Scatterplots The simplest of the 5NG are scatterplots (also called bivariate plots); they allow you to investigate the relationship between two numerical variables. While you may already be familiar with this type of plot, let’s view it through the lens of the Grammar of Graphics. Specifically, we will graphically investigate the relationship between the following two numerical variables in the flights data frame: dep_delay: departure delay on the horizontal “x” axis and arr_delay: arrival delay on the vertical “y” axis for Alaska Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2013. This requires paring down the flights data frame to a smaller data frame all_alaska_flights consisting of only Alaska Airlines (carrier code “AS”) flights. Don’t worry for now if you don’t fully understand what this code is doing, we’ll explain this in details Chapter 5, just run it all and understand that we are taking all flights and only considering those corresponding to Alaska Airlines. all_alaska_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;) This code snippet makes use of functions in the dplyr package for data wrangling to achieve our goal: it takes the flights data frame and filters it to only return the rows which meet the condition carrier == &quot;AS&quot;. Recall from Section 2.2 that testing for equality is specified with == and not =. You will see many more examples of == and filter() in Chapter 5. Learning check (LC3.1) Take a look at both the flights and all_alaska_flights data frames by running View(flights) and View(all_alaska_flights) in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.1): flights contains all flight data, while all_alaska_flights contains only data from Alaskan carrier “AS”. We can see that flights has 336776 rows while all_alaska_flights has only 714 3.3.1 Scatterplots via geom_point We proceed to create the scatterplot using the ggplot() function: ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point() Figure 3.2: Arrival Delays vs Departure Delays for Alaska Airlines flights from NYC in 2013 In Figure 3.2 we see that a positive relationship exists between dep_delay and arr_delay: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase. We also note that the majority of points fall near the point (0, 0). There is a large mass of points clustered there. Let’s break this down, keeping in mind our discussion in Section 3.1: Within the ggplot() function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar: The data frame to be all_alaska_flights by setting data = all_alaska_flights The aesthetic mapping by setting aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay). Specifically the variable dep_delay maps to the x position aesthetic the variable arr_delay maps to the y position aesthetic We add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object. In this case the geometric object are points, set by specifying geom_point(). Some notes on layers: Note that the + sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning. You’ll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning. When adding layers to a plot, you are encouraged to hit Return on your keyboard after entering the + so that the code for each layer is on a new line. As we add more and more layers to plots, you’ll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code. To stress the importance of adding layers, in particular the layer specifying the geometric object, consider Figure 3.3 where no layers are added. A not very useful plot! ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) Figure 3.3: Plot with No Layers Learning check (LC3.2) What are some practical reasons why dep_delay and arr_delay have a positive relationship? (LC3.3) What variables (not necessarily in the flights data frame) would you expect to have a negative correlation (i.e. a negative relationship) with dep_delay? Why? Remember that we are focusing on numerical variables here. (LC3.4) Why do you believe there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Alaskan flights? (LC3.5) What are some other features of the plot that stand out to you? (LC3.6) Create a new scatterplot using different variables in the all_alaska_flights data frame by modifying the example above. Learning Check Solutions (LC3.2): The later a plane departs, typically the later it will arrive. (LC3.3): An example in the weather dataset is visibility, which measure visibility in miles. As visibility increases, we would expect departure delays to decrease. (LC3.4): The point (0,0) means no delay in departure nor arrival. From the point of view of Alaska airlines, this means the flight was on time. It seems most flights are at least close to being on time. (LC3.5): Different people will answer this one differently. One answer is most flights depart and arrive less than an hour late. (LC3.6): Many possibilities for this one, see the plot below. Is there a pattern in departure delay depending on when the flight is scheduled to depart? Interestingly, there seems to be only two blocks of time where flights depart. ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_time, y = dep_delay)) + geom_point() 3.3.2 Over-plotting The large mass of points near (0, 0) in Figure 3.2 can cause some confusion. This is the result of a phenomenon called overplotting. As one may guess, this corresponds to values being plotted on top of each other over and over again. It is often difficult to know just how many values are plotted in this way when looking at a basic scatterplot as we have here. There are two ways to address this issue: By adjusting the transparency of the points via the alpha argument By jittering the points via geom_jitter() The first way of relieving overplotting is by changing the alpha argument in geom_point() which controls the transparency of the points. By default, this value is set to 1. We can change this to any value between 0 and 1 where 0 sets the points to be 100% transparent and 1 sets the points to be 100% opaque. Note how the following function call is identical to the one in Section 3.3, but with alpha = 0.2 added to the geom_point(). ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) Figure 3.4: Delay scatterplot with alpha=0.2 The key feature to note in Figure 3.4 is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. Note that there is no aes() surrounding alpha = 0.2 here. Since we are NOT mapping a variable to an aesthetic but instead are just changing a setting, we don’t need to create a mapping with aes(). In fact, you’ll receive an error if you try to change the second line above to geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2)). The second way of relieving overplotting is to jitter the points a bit. In other words, we are going to add just a bit of random noise to the points to better see them and remove some of the overplotting. You can think of “jittering” as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Instead of using geom_point, we use geom_jitter to perform this shaking. To specify how much jitter to add, we adjust the width and height arguments. This corresponds to how hard you’d like to shake the plot in units corresponding to those for both the horizontal and vertical variables (in this case, minutes). ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) Figure 3.5: Jittered delay scatterplot Note how this function call is identical to the one in Subsection 3.3.1, but with geom_point() replaced with geom_jitter(). The plot in Figure 3.5 helps us a little bit in getting a sense for the overplotting, but with a relatively large data-set like this one (714 flights), it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting alpha proved more effective. We’ll see later on that the two following R commands will yield the exact same plot: ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) ggplot(all_alaska_flights, aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) In other words you can drop the data = and mapping = if you keep the order of the two arguments the same. Since the ggplot() function is expecting its first argument data to be a data frame and its second argument to correspond to mapping =, you can omit both and you’ll get the same plot. As you get more and more practice, you’ll likely find yourself not including the specification of the argument like this. But for now to keep things straightforward let’s make it a point to include the data = and mapping =. Learning check (LC3.7) Why is setting the alpha argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? (LC3.8) After viewing the Figure 3.4 above, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur the most frequently. How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the alpha = 0.2 set in Figure 3.2? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.7): Why is setting the alpha argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? It thins out the points so we address overplotting. But more importantly it hints at the (statistical) density and distribution of the points: where are the points concentrated, where do they occur. We will see more about densities and distributions in Chapter 6 when we switch gears to statistical topics. (LC3.8): After viewing the Figure 3.4 above, give a range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur most frequently? How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the alpha = 0.2 set in Figure 3.2? The lower plot suggests that most Alaska flights from NYC depart between 12 minutes early and on time and arrive between 50 minutes early and on time. 3.3.3 Summary Scatterplots display the relationship between two numerical variables. They are among the most commonly used plots because they can provide an immediate way to see the trend in one variable versus another. However, if you try to create a scatterplot where either one of the two variables is not numerical, you will get strange results. Be careful! With medium to large data-sets, you may need to play with either geom_jitter() or the alpha argument in order to get a good feel for relationships in your data. This tweaking is often a fun part of data visualization since you’ll have the chance to see different relationships come about as you make subtle changes to your plots. 3.4 5NG#2: Linegraphs The next of the 5NG is a linegraph. They are most frequently used when the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents some other numerical variable; such plots are known as time series. Time represents a variable that is connected together by each day following the previous day. In other words, time has a natural ordering. Linegraphs should be avoided when there is not a clear sequential ordering to the explanatory variable, i.e. the x-variable or the predictor variable. Our focus now turns to the temp variable in this weather data-set. By Looking over the weather data-set by typing View(weather) in the console. Running ?weather to bring up the help file. We can see that the temp variable corresponds to hourly temperature (in Fahrenheit) recordings at weather stations near airports in New York City. Instead of considering all hours in 2013 for all three airports in NYC, let’s focus on the hourly temperature at Newark airport (origin code “EWR”) for the first 15 days in January 2013. The weather data frame in the nycflights13 package contains this data, but we first need to filter it to only include those rows that correspond to Newark in the first 15 days of January. early_january_weather &lt;- weather %&gt;% filter(origin == &quot;EWR&quot; &amp; month == 1 &amp; day &lt;= 15) This is similar to the previous use of the filter command in Section 3.3, however we now use the &amp; operator. The above selects only those rows in weather where the originating airport is &quot;EWR&quot; and we are in the first month and the day is from 1 to 15 inclusive. Learning check (LC3.9) Take a look at both the weather and early_january_weather data frames by running View(weather) and View(early_january_weather) in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? (LC3.10) View() the flights data frame again. Why does the time_hour variable uniquely identify the hour of the measurement whereas the hour variable does not? Learning Check Solutions LC (LC3.9): Take a look at both the weather and early_january_weather data frames by running View(weather) and View(early_january_weather) in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? The rows of early_january_weather are a subset of weather. LC(LC3.10): View() the flights data frame again. Why does the time_hour variable correctly identify the hour of the measurement whereas the hour variable does not? Because to uniquely identify an hour, we need the year/month/day/hour sequence, whereas there are only 24 possible hour’s. 3.4.1 Linegraphs via geom_line We plot a linegraph of hourly temperature using geom_line(): ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_line() Figure 3.6: Hourly Temperature in Newark for January 1-15, 2013 Much as with the ggplot() call in Chapter 3.3.1, we describe the components of the Grammar of Graphics: Within the ggplot() function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar: The data frame to be early_january_weather by setting data = early_january_weather The aesthetic mapping by setting aes(x = time_hour, y = temp). Specifically time_hour (i.e. the time variable) maps to the x position temp maps to the y position We add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object in question. In this case the geometric object is a line, set by specifying geom_line(). Learning check (LC3.11) Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? (LC3.12) Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable? (LC3.13) Plot a time series of a variable other than temp for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013. Learning Check Solutions LC (LC3.11): Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? Because lines suggest connectedness and ordering. LC (LC3.12): Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable? Because time is sequential: subsequent observations are closely related to each other. LC (LC3.13): Plot a time series of a variable other than temp for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013. Humidity is a good one to look at, since this very closely related to the cycles of a day. ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = humid)) + geom_line() 3.4.2 Summary Linegraphs, just like scatterplots, display the relationship between two numerical variables. However, the variable on the x-axis (i.e. the explanatory variable) should have a natural ordering, like some notion of time. We can mislead our audience if that isn’t the case. 3.5 5NG#3: Histograms Let’s consider the temp variable in the weather data frame once again, but now unlike with the linegraphs in Chapter 3.4, let’s say we don’t care about the relationship of temperature to time, but rather we care about the (statistical) distribution of temperatures. We could just produce points where each of the different values appear on something similar to a number line: Figure 3.7: Plot of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013 This gives us a general idea of how the values of temp differ. We see that temperatures vary from around 11 up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The area between 40 and 60 degrees appears to have more points plotted than outside that range. 3.5.1 Histograms via geom_histogram What is commonly produced instead of the above plot is a plot known as a histogram. The histogram shows how many elements of a single numerical variable fall in specified bins. In this case, these bins may correspond to between 0-10°F, 10-20°F, etc. We produce a histogram of the hour temperatures at all three NYC airports in 2013: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram() `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). Figure 3.8: Histogram of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013 Note here: There is only one variable being mapped in aes(): the single numerical variable temp. You don’t need to compute the y-aesthetic: it gets computed automatically. We set the geometric object to be geom_histogram() We got a warning message of 1 rows containing non-finite values being removed. This is due to one of the values of temperature being missing. R is alerting us that this happened. Another warning corresponds to an urge to specify the number of bins you’d like to create. 3.5.2 Adjusting the bins We can adjust characteristics of the bins in one of two ways: By adjusting the number of bins via the bins argument By adjusting the width of the bins via the binwidth argument First, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to put the data into as an argument in the geom_histogram() function. By default, this is chosen to be 30 somewhat arbitrarily; we have received a warning above our plot that this was done. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = &quot;white&quot;) Figure 3.9: Histogram of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013 - 60 Bins Note the addition of the color argument. If you’d like to be able to more easily differentiate each of the bins, you can specify the color of the outline as done above. You can also adjust the color of the bars by setting the fill argument. Type colors() in your console to see all 657 available colors. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) Figure 3.10: Histogram of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013 - 60 Colored Bins Second, instead of specifying the number of bins, we can also specify the width of the bins by using the binwidth argument in the geom_histogram function. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) Figure 3.11: Histogram of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013 - Binwidth = 10 Learning check (LC3.14) What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 60 tell us about the distribution of temperatures? (LC3.15) Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed? (LC3.16) What would you guess is the “center” value in this distribution? Why did you make that choice? (LC3.17) Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close? Why? Learning Check Solutions LC (LC3.14): What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 60 tell us about the distribution of temperatures? The distribution doesn’t change much. But by refining the bid width, we see that the temperature data has a high degree of accuracy. What do I mean by accuracy? Looking at the temp variabile by View(weather), we see that the precision of each temperature recording is 2 decimal places. LC (LC3.15): Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed? It is rather symmetric, i.e. there are no long tails on only one side of the distribution LC (LC3.16): What would you guess is the “center” value in this distribution? Why did you make that choice? The center is around 55.2035149°F. By running the summary() command, we see that the mean and median are very similar. In fact, when the distribution is symmetric the mean equals the median. (LC3.17): Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close? Why? This can only be answered relatively speaking! Let’s pick things to be relative to Seattle, WA temperatures: While, it appears that Seattle weather has a similar center of 55°F, its temperatures are almost entirely between 35°F and 75°F for a range of about 40°F. Seattle temperatures are much less spread out than New York i.e. much more consistent over the year. New York on the other hand has much colder days in the winter and much hotter days in the summer. Expressed differently, the middle 50% of values, as delineated by the interquartile range is 30°F: IQR(weather$temp, na.rm=TRUE) [1] 30.06 summary(weather$temp) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s 10.94 39.92 55.04 55.20 69.98 100.04 1 3.5.3 Summary Histograms, unlike scatterplots and linegraphs, present information on only a single numerical variable. In particular they are visualizations of the (statistical) distribution of values. 3.6 Facets Before continuing the 5NG, we briefly introduce a new concept called faceting. Faceting is used when we’d like to create small multiples of the same plot over a different categorical variable. By default, all of the small multiples will have the same vertical axis. For example, suppose we were interested in looking at how the temperature histograms we saw in Chapter 3.5 varied by month. This is what is meant by “the distribution of a variable over another variable”: temp is one variable and month is the other variable. In order to look at histograms of temp for each month, we add a layer facet_wrap(~ month). You can also specify how many rows you’d like the small multiple plots to be in using nrow or how many columns using ncol inside of facet_wrap. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ month, nrow = 4) Figure 3.12: Faceted histogram Note the use of the ~ before month in facet_wrap. The tilde (~) is required and you’ll receive the error Error in as.quoted(facets) : object 'month' not found if you don’t include it before month here. As we might expect, the temperature tends to increase as summer approaches and then decrease as winter approaches. Learning check (LC3.18) What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above? How does a faceted plot help us see relationships between two variables? (LC3.19) What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above? What about 25, 50, 75, 100? (LC3.20) For which types of data-sets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the nature of these variables and other important characteristics. (LC3.21) Does the temp variable in the weather data-set have a lot of variability? Why do you say that? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.18): What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above? How does afaceted plot help us see relationships between two variables? Certain months have much more consistent weather (August in particular), while others have crazy variability like January and October, representing changes in the seasons. The two variables we are see the relationship of are temp and month. LC (LC3.19): What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above? What about 25, 50, 75, 100? While month is technically a number between 1-12, we’re viewing it as a categorical variable here. Specifically an ordinal categorical variable since there is a ordering to the categories 25, 50, 75, 100 are temperatures (LC3.20): For which types of datasets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the variability of the variables and other important characteristics? Having histograms split by day would not be great: We’d have 365 facets to look at. Way to many. We don’t really care about day-to-day fluctuation in weather so much, but maybe more week-to-week variation. We’d like to focus on seasonal trends. (LC3.21): Does the temp variable in the weather dataset have a lot of variability? Why do you say that? Again, like in LC (LC3.17), this is a relative question. I would say yes, because in New York City, you have 4 clear seasons with different weather. Whereas in Seattle WA and Portland OR, you have two seasons: summer and rain! 3.7 5NG#4: Boxplots While using faceted histograms can provide a way to compare distributions of a numerical variable split by groups of a categorical variable as in Section 3.6, an alternative plot called a boxplot (also called a side-by-side boxplot) achieves the same task and is frequently preferred. The boxplot uses the information provided in the five-number summary referred to in Appendix A. It gives a way to compare this summary information across the different levels of a categorical variable. 3.7.1 Boxplots via geom_boxplot Let’s create a boxplot to compare the monthly temperatures as we did above with the faceted histograms. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = temp)) + geom_boxplot() Figure 3.13: Invalid boxplot specification Warning messages: 1: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? 2: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). Note the set of warnings that is given here. The second warning corresponds to missing values in the data frame and it is turned off on subsequent plots. Let’s focus on the first warning. Observe that this plot does not look like what we were expecting. We were expecting to see the distribution of temperatures for each month (so 12 different boxplots). The first warning is letting us know that we are plotting a numerical, and not categorical variable, on the x-axis. This gives us the overall boxplot without any other groupings. We can get around this by introducing a new function for our x variable: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) + geom_boxplot() Figure 3.14: Month by temp boxplot We have introduced a new function called factor() here. One of the things this function does is to convert a discrete value like month (1, 2, …, 12) into a categorical variable. The “box” part of this plot represents the 25th percentile, the median (50th percentile), and the 75th percentile. The dots correspond to outliers. (The specific formulation for these outliers is discussed in Appendix A.) The lines show how the data varies that is not in the center 50% defined by the first and third quantiles. Longer lines correspond to more variability and shorter lines correspond to less variability. Looking at this plot we can see, as expected, that summer months (6 through 8) have higher median temperatures. We can easily compare temperatures across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the height of the 12 boxes are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of temperatures recorded in a given month. But to really bring home what boxplots show, let’s focus only on the month of November’s 2138 temperature recordings. Figure 3.15: November boxplot Now let’s plot all 2138 temperature recordings for November on top of the boxplot in Figure 3.16. Figure 3.16: November boxplot with points What the boxplot does is summarize the 2138 points for you, in particular: 25% of points (about 534 observations) fall below the bottom edge of the box which is the first quartile of 35.96 degrees Farenheit (2.2 degrees Celsius). In other words 25% of observations were colder than 35.96 degrees Farenheit. 25% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line which is the median of 46.04 degrees Farenheit (7.8 degrees Celsius). In other words 25% of observations were between 35.96 and 46.04 degrees Farenheit. 25% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box which is the third quartile of 51.98 degrees Farenheit (11.1 degrees Celsius). In other words 25% of observations were between 46.04 and 51.98 degrees Farenheit. 25% of points fall over the top edge of the box. In other words 25% of observations were warmer than 51.98 degrees Farenheit. Learning check (LC3.22) What does the dot at the bottom of the plot for May correspond to? Explain what might have occurred in May to produce this point. (LC3.23) Which months have the highest variability in temperature? What reasons do you think this is? (LC3.24) We looked at the distribution of a numerical variable over a categorical variable here with this boxplot. Why can’t we look at the distribution of one numerical variable over the distribution of another numerical variable? Say, temperature across pressure, for example? (LC3.25) Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers. Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.22): What does the dot at the bottom of the plot for May correspond to? Explain what might have occurred in May to produce this point. It appears to be an outlier. Let’s revisit the use of the filter command to hone in on it. We want all data points where the month is 5 and temp&lt;25 weather %&gt;% filter(month==5 &amp; temp &lt; 25) There appears to be only one hour and only at JFK that recorded 13.1 F (-10.5 C) in the month of May. This is probably a data entry mistake! Why wasn’t the weather at least similar at EWR (Newark) and LGA (La Guardia)? (LC3.23): Which months have the highest variability in temperature? What reasons do you think this is? We are now interested in the spread of the data. One measure some of you may have seen previously is the standard deviation. But in this plot we can read off the Interquartile Range (IQR): The distance from the 1st to the 3rd quartiles i.e. the length of the boxes You can also think of this as the spread of the middle 50% of the data Just from eyeballing it, it seems November has the biggest IQR, i.e. the widest box, so has the most variation in temperature August has the smallest IQR, i.e. the narrowest box, so is the most consistent temperature-wise Here’s how we compute the exact IQR values for each month (we’ll see this more in depth Chapter 5 of the text): group the observations by month then for each group, i.e. month, summarize it by applying the summary statistic function IQR(), while making sure to skip over missing data via na.rm=TRUE then arrange the table in descending order of IQR weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(IQR = IQR(temp, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(IQR)) month IQR 11 16.02 12 13.68 1 12.96 9 12.06 4 12.06 5 11.88 6 10.98 10 10.98 2 10.08 7 9.18 3 9.00 8 7.02 (LC3.24): We looked at the distribution of a numerical variable over a categorical variable here with this boxplot. Why can’t we look at the distribution of one numerical variable over the distribution of another numerical variable? Say, temperature across pressure, for example? Because we need a way to group many numerical observations together, say by grouping by month. For pressure, we have near unique values for pressure, i.e. no groups, so we can’t make boxplots. (LC3.25): Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers. Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram? In a histogram, the bin corresponding to where an outlier lies may not by high enough for us to see. In a boxplot, they are explicitly labelled separately. 3.7.2 Summary Boxplots provide a way to compare and contrast the distribution of one quantitative variable across multiple levels of one categorical variable. One can see where the median falls across the different groups by looking at the center line in the box. To see how spread out the variable is across the different groups, look at both the width of the box and also how far the lines stretch vertically from the box. (If the lines stretch far from the box but the box has a small width, the variability of the values closer to the center is much smaller than the variability of the outer ends of the variable.) Outliers are even more easily identified when looking at a boxplot than when looking at a histogram. 3.8 5NG#5: Barplots Both histograms and boxplots represent ways to visualize the variability of numerical variables. Another common task is to present the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, focused on how many elements from the data fall into different categories of the categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts (also known as frequencies) is via a barplot, also known as a barchart. One complication, however, is how your data is represented: is the categorical variable of interest “pre-counted” or not? For example, run the following code in your Console. This code manually creates two data frames representing a collection of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. fruits &lt;- data_frame( fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;) ) fruits_counted &lt;- data_frame( fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), number = c(3, 2) ) We see both the fruits and fruits_counted data frames represent the same collection of fruit. Whereas fruits just lists the fruit individually: Table 3.3: Fruits fruit apple apple apple orange orange fruits_counted has a variable count which represents pre-counted values of each fruit. Table 3.4: Fruits (Pre-Counted) fruit number apple 3 orange 2 3.8.1 Barplots via geom_bar/geom_col Let’s generate barplots using these two different representations of the same basket of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. Using the not pre-counted data fruits from Table 3.3: ggplot(data = fruits, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) + geom_bar() Figure 3.17: Barplot when counts are not pre-counted and using the pre-counted data fruits_counted from Table 3.4: ggplot(data = fruits_counted, mapping = aes(x = fruit, y = number)) + geom_col() Figure 3.18: Barplot when counts are pre-counted Compare the barplots in Figures 3.17 and 3.18, which are identical, but are based on the two different data frames. Observe that: The code that generates Figure 3.17 based on fruits does not map a variable to the y aesthetic and uses geom_bar(). The code that generates Figure 3.18 based on fruits_counted maps the number variable to the y aesthetic and uses geom_col() Stating the above differently: When the categorical variable you want to plot is not pre-counted in your data frame you need to use geom_bar(). When the categorical variable is pre-counted (in the above fruits_counted example in the variable number), you need to use geom_col() with the y aesthetic explicitly mapped. Please note that understanding this difference is one of ggplot2’s trickier aspects that causes the most confusion, and fortunately this is as complicated as our use of ggplot2 is going to get. Let’s consider a different distribution: the distribution of airlines that flew out of New York City in 2013. Here we explore the number of flights from each airline/carrier. This can be plotted by invoking the geom_bar function in ggplot2: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() Figure 3.19: Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline using geom_bar To get an understanding of what the names of these airlines are corresponding to these carrier codes, we can look at the airlines data frame in the nycflights13 package. airlines carrier name 9E Endeavor Air Inc. AA American Airlines Inc. AS Alaska Airlines Inc. B6 JetBlue Airways DL Delta Air Lines Inc. EV ExpressJet Airlines Inc. F9 Frontier Airlines Inc. FL AirTran Airways Corporation HA Hawaiian Airlines Inc. MQ Envoy Air OO SkyWest Airlines Inc. UA United Air Lines Inc. US US Airways Inc. VX Virgin America WN Southwest Airlines Co. YV Mesa Airlines Inc. Going back to our barplot, we see that United Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, and ExpressJet Airlines had the most flights depart New York City in 2013. To get the actual number of flights by each airline we can use the group_by(), summarize(), and n() functions in the dplyr package on the carrier variable in flights, which we will introduce formally in Chapter 5. flights_table &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(carrier) %&gt;% summarize(number = n()) flights_table carrier number 9E 18460 AA 32729 AS 714 B6 54635 DL 48110 EV 54173 F9 685 FL 3260 HA 342 MQ 26397 OO 32 UA 58665 US 20536 VX 5162 WN 12275 YV 601 In this table, the counts of the carriers are pre-counted. To create a barplot using the data frame flights_table, we use geom_col() instead of geom_bar() map the y aesthetic to the variable number. Compare this barplot using geom_col in Figure 3.20 with the earlier barplot using geom_bar in Figure 3.19. They are identical. However the input data we used for these are different. ggplot(data = flights_table, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = number)) + geom_col() Figure 3.20: Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline using geom_col Learning check (LC3.26) Why are histograms inappropriate for visualizing categorical variables? (LC3.27) What is the difference between histograms and barplots? (LC3.28) How many Envoy Air flights departed NYC in 2013? (LC3.29) What was the seventh highest airline in terms of departed flights from NYC in 2013? How could we better present the table to get this answer quickly? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.26): Why are histograms inappropriate for visualizing categorical variables? Histograms are for numerical variables i.e. the horizontal part of each histogram bar represents an interval, whereas for a categorical variable each bar represents only one level of the categorical variable. (LC3.27): What is the difference between histograms and barplots? See above. (LC3.28): How many Envoy Air flights departed NYC in 2013? Envoy Air is carrier code MQ and thus 26397 flights departed NYC in 2013. (LC3.29): What was the seventh highest airline in terms of departed flights from NYC in 2013? How could we better present the table to get this answer quickly? What a pain! We’ll see in Chapter 5 on Data Wrangling that applying arrange(desc(n)) will sort this table in descending order of n! 3.8.2 Must avoid pie charts! Unfortunately, one of the most common plots seen today for categorical data is the pie chart. While they may see harmless enough, they actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well. As Naomi Robbins describes in her book “Creating More Effective Graphs” (Robbins 2013), we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees. In other words, it is difficult for us to determine relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another. Let’s examine our previous barplot example on the number of flights departing NYC by airline. This time we will use a pie chart. As you review this chart, try to identify how much larger the portion of the pie is for ExpressJet Airlines (EV) compared to US Airways (US), what the third largest carrier is in terms of departing flights, and how many carriers have fewer flights than United Airlines (UA)? Figure 3.21: The dreaded pie chart While it is quite easy to look back at the barplot to get the answer to these questions, it’s quite difficult to get the answers correct when looking at the pie graph. Barplots can always present the information in a way that is easier for the eye to determine relative position. There may be one exception from Nathan Yau at FlowingData.com but we will leave this for the reader to decide: Figure 3.22: The only good pie chart Learning check (LC3.30) Why should pie charts be avoided and replaced by barplots? (LC3.31) What is your opinion as to why pie charts continue to be used? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.30): Why should pie charts be avoided and replaced by barplots? In my opinion, comparisons using horizontal lines are easier than comparing angles and areas of circles. (LC3.31): What is your opinion as to why pie charts continue to be used? Legacy? 3.8.3 Using barplots to compare two categorical variables Barplots are the go-to way to visualize the frequency of different categories of a categorical variable. They make it easy to order the counts and to compare the frequencies of one group to another. Another use of barplots (unfortunately, sometimes inappropriately and confusingly) is to compare two categorical variables together. Let’s examine the distribution of outgoing flights from NYC by carrier and airport. We begin by getting the names of the airports in NYC that were included in the flights data-set. Here, we preview the inner_join() function from Chapter 5. This function will join the data frame flights with the data frame airports by matching rows that have the same airport code. However, in flights the airport code is included in the origin variable whereas in airports the airport code is included in the faa variable. We will revisit such examples in Section 5.8 on joining data-sets. flights_namedports &lt;- flights %&gt;% inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;origin&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) After running View(flights_namedports), we see that name now corresponds to the name of the airport as referenced by the origin variable. We will now plot carrier as the horizontal variable. When we specify geom_bar, it will specify count as being the vertical variable. A new addition here is fill = name. Look over what was produced from the plot to get an idea of what this argument gives. ggplot(data = flights_namedports, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) + geom_bar() Figure 3.23: Stacked barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport This plot is what is known as a stacked barplot. While simple to make, it often leads to many problems. For example in this plot, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors (corresponding to the number of flights from each airport) between the bars (corresponding to the different carriers). Note that fill is an aesthetic just like x is an aesthetic, and thus must be included within the parentheses of the aes() mapping. The following code, where the fill aesthetic is specified on the outside will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new ggplot users make: ggplot(data = flights_namedports, mapping = aes(x = carrier), fill = name) + geom_bar() Learning check (LC3.32) What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure? (LC3.33) What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.32) What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure? Because the red, green, and blue bars don’t all start at 0 (only red does), it makes comparing counts hard. (LC3.33) What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights? The different airlines prefer different airports. For example, United is mostly a Newark carrier and JetBlue is a JFK carrier. If airlines didn’t prefer airports, each color would be roughly one third of each bar.} Another variation on the stacked barplot is the side-by-side barplot also called a dodged barplot. ggplot(data = flights_namedports, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) Figure 3.24: Side-by-side AKA dodged barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport Learning check (LC3.34) Why might the side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case? (LC3.35) What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot, in general? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.34) Why might the side-by-side barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case? We can easily compare the different aiports for a given carrier using a single comparison line i.e. things are lined up (LC3.35) What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side barplot, in general? It is hard to get totals for each airline. Lastly, an often preferred type of barplot is the faceted barplot. We already saw this concept of faceting and small multiples in Section 3.6. This gives us a nicer way to compare the distributions across both carrier and airport/name. ggplot(data = flights_namedports, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = name)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ name, ncol = 1) Figure 3.25: Faceted barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and airport Learning check (LC3.36) Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case? (LC3.37) What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot? Learning Check Solutions (LC3.36) Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case? Not that different than using side-by-side; depends on how you want to organize your presentation. (LC3.37) What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot? Now we can also compare the different carriers within a particular airport easily too. For example, we can read off who the top carrier for each airport is easily using a single horizontal line. 3.8.4 Summary Barplots are the preferred way of displaying categorical variables. They are easy-to-understand and make it easy to compare across groups of a categorical variable. When dealing with more than one categorical variable, faceted barplots are frequently preferred over side-by-side or stacked barplots. Stacked barplots are sometimes nice to look at, but it is quite difficult to compare across the levels since the sizes of the bars are all of different sizes. Side-by-side barplots can provide an improvement on this, but the issue about comparing across groups still must be dealt with. 3.9 Conclusion 3.9.1 Review questions Review questions have been designed using the fivethirtyeight R package (Kim, Ismay, and Chunn 2018) with links to the corresponding FiveThirtyEight.com articles in our free DataCamp course Effective Data Storytelling using the tidyverse. The material in this chapter is covered in the chapters of the DataCamp course available below: Scatterplots &amp; Linegraphs Histograms &amp; Boxplots Barplots ggplot2 Review 3.9.2 What’s to come? In Chapter 4, we’ll introduce the concept of “tidy data” and how it is used as a key data format for all the packages we use in this textbook. You’ll see that the concept appears to be simple, but actually can be a little challenging to decipher without careful practice. We’ll also investigate how to import CSV (comma-separated value) files into R using the readr package. 3.9.3 Resources An excellent resource as you begin to create plots using the ggplot2 package is a cheatsheet that RStudio has put together entitled “Data Visualization with ggplot2” available by clicking here or by clicking the RStudio Menu Bar -&gt; Help -&gt; Cheatsheets -&gt; “Data Visualization with ggplot2” This cheatsheet covers more than what we’ve discussed in this chapter but provides nice visual descriptions of what each function produces. 3.9.4 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here.

["4-tidy.html", "4 Tidy Data via tidyr 4.1 What is tidy data? 4.2 Back to nycflights13 4.3 Importing CSVs via readr 4.4 Converting from wide to long 4.5 Optional: Normal forms of data 4.6 Conclusion", " 4 Tidy Data via tidyr In Subsection 2.2.1 we introduced the concept of a data frame: a rectangular spreadsheet-like representation of data in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables describing each observation. In Section 2.4, we started explorations of our first data frame flights included in the nycflights13 package. In Chapter 3 we made graphics using data contained in flights and other data frames. In this chapter, we extend some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called “tidy” data. You will see that having data stored in “tidy” format is about more than what the colloquial definition of the term “tidy” might suggest of having your data “neatly organized” in a spreadsheet. Instead, we define the term “tidy” in a more rigorous fashion, outlining a set of rules by which data can be stored and the implications of these rules on analyses. Although knowledge of this type of data formatting was not necessary in our treatment of data visualization in Chapter 3 since all the data was already in tidy format, we’ll see going forward that having tidy data will allow you to more easily create data visualizations in a wide range of settings. Furthermore, it will also help you with data wrangling in Chapter 5 and in all subsequent chapters in this book when we cover regression and discuss statistical inference. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(nycflights13) library(tidyr) library(readr) 4.1 What is tidy data? You have surely heard the word “tidy” in your life: “Tidy up your room!” “Please write your homework in a tidy way so that it is easier to grade and to provide feedback.” Marie Kondo’s best-selling book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing “I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - ‘Read me, please!’” - Linda Grant What does it mean for your data to be “tidy”? Beyond just being organized, in the context of this book having “tidy” data means that your data follows a standardized format. This makes it easier for you and others to visualize your data, to wrangle/transform your data, and to model your data. We will follow Hadley Wickham’s definition of tidy data here (Wickham 2014): A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings AKA text data (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes. Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table. Figure 4.1: Tidy data graphic from http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html For example, say the following table consists of stock prices: Table 4.1: Stock Prices (Non-Tidy Format) Date Boeing Stock Price Amazon Stock Price Google Stock Price 2009-01-01 $173.55 $174.90 $174.34 2009-01-02 $172.61 $171.42 $170.04 Although the data are neatly organized in a spreadsheet-type format, they are not in tidy format since there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (Date, Stock Name, and Stock Price), but there are not three columns. In tidy data format each variable should be its own column, as shown below. Notice that both tables present the same information, but in different formats. Table 4.2: Stock Prices (Tidy Format) Date Stock Name Stock Price 2009-01-01 Boeing $173.55 2009-01-02 Boeing $172.61 2009-01-01 Amazon $174.90 2009-01-02 Amazon $171.42 2009-01-01 Google $174.34 2009-01-02 Google $170.04 However, consider the following table Table 4.3: Date, Boeing Price, Weather Data Date Boeing Price Weather 2009-01-01 $173.55 Sunny 2009-01-02 $172.61 Overcast In this case, even though the variable “Boeing Price” occurs again, the data is tidy since there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (Date, Boeing stock price, and the weather that particular day). The non-tidy data format in the original table is also known as “wide” format whereas the tidy data format in the second table is also known as “long”/“narrow” data format. In this book, we will work with work with datasets that are already in tidy format. But data isn’t always in this nice format that the tidyverse gets its name from. Data actually may come to you in a variety of different formats that require data cleaning and reshaping beyond the scope of this book. For a thorough example of the steps needed to take a messy dataset and turn it into a tidy one, check out the different functions available for data tidying and a case study using data from the World Health Organization in R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). 4.2 Back to nycflights13 Recall the nycflights13 package with data about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013 that we introduced in Section 2.4 and used extensively in Chapter 3 to create visualizations. In particular, let’s revisit the flights data frame by running View(flights) in your console. We see that flights has a rectangular shape with each row corresponding to a different flight and each column corresponding to a characteristic of that flight. This matches exactly with how Hadley Wickham defined tidy data: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. But what about the third property? Each type of observational unit forms a table. 4.2.1 Observational units We identified earlier that the observational unit in the flights dataset is an individual flight. And we have shown that this dataset consists of 336,776 flights with 19 variables. In other words, rows of this dataset don’t refer to a measurement on an airline or on an airport; they refer to characteristics/measurements on a given flight from New York City in 2013. Also included in the nycflights13 package are datasets with different observational units (Wickham 2017): airlines: translation between two letter IATA carrier codes and names (16 in total) planes: construction information about each of 3,322 planes used weather: hourly meteorological data (about 8710 observations) for each of the three NYC airports airports: airport names and locations The organization of this data follows the third “tidy” data property: observations corresponding to the same observational unit should be saved in the same table/data frame. 4.2.2 Identification vs measurement variables There is a subtle difference between the kinds of variables that you will encounter in data frames: measurement variables and identification variables. The airports data frame you worked with above contains both these types of variables. Recall that in airports the observational unit is an airport, and thus each row corresponds to one particular airport. Let’s pull them apart using the glimpse function: glimpse(airports) Observations: 1,458 Variables: 8 $ faa &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04G&quot;, &quot;06A&quot;, &quot;06C&quot;, &quot;06N&quot;, &quot;09J&quot;, &quot;0A9&quot;, &quot;0G6&quot;, &quot;0G7&quot;, &quot;0P2&quot;... $ name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Lansdowne Airport&quot;, &quot;Moton Field Municipal Airport&quot;, &quot;Schaum... $ lat &lt;dbl&gt; 41.13047, 32.46057, 41.98934, 41.43191, 31.07447, 36.37122, 4... $ lon &lt;dbl&gt; -80.61958, -85.68003, -88.10124, -74.39156, -81.42778, -82.17... $ alt &lt;int&gt; 1044, 264, 801, 523, 11, 1593, 730, 492, 1000, 108, 409, 875,... $ tz &lt;dbl&gt; -5, -6, -6, -5, -5, -5, -5, -5, -5, -8, -5, -6, -5, -5, -5, -... $ dst &lt;chr&gt; &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;... $ tzone &lt;chr&gt; &quot;America/New_York&quot;, &quot;America/Chicago&quot;, &quot;America/Chicago&quot;, &quot;Am... The variables faa and name are what we will call identification variables: variables that uniquely identify each observational unit. They are mainly used to provide a name to the observational unit. faa gives the code provided by the FAA for that airport while the name variable gives the longer more natural name of the airport. The remaining variables (lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, tzone) are often called measurement or characteristic variables: variables that describe properties of each observational unit, in other words each observation in each row. For example, lat and long describe the latitude and longitude of each airport. While it is not an absolute rule, for organizational purposes it is considered good practice to have your identification variables in the far left-most columns of your data frame. Learning check (LC4.1) What properties of the observational unit do each of lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, and tzone describe for the airports data frame? Note that you may want to use ?airports to get more information. (LC4.2) Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables in which one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not. In other words, create your own tidy dataset that matches these conditions. Learning Check Solutions (LC4.1) lat long represent the airport geographic coordinates, alt is the altitude above sea level of the airport (Run airports %&gt;% filter(faa == &quot;DEN&quot;) to see the altitude of Denver International Airport), tz is the time zone difference with respect to GMT in London UK, dst is the daylight savings time zone, and tzone is the time zone label. (LC4.2) Identification Variables In the weather example in LC3.8, the combination of origin, year, month, day, hour are identification variables as they identify the observation in question. Anything else pertains to observations: temp, humid, wind_speed, etc. Most frequently though, data that isn’t in long format and is instead in wide format can be converted into “tidy” format by using the tidyr package (Wickham and Henry 2018) in the tidyverse. We’ll now investigate how that can be done using the gather() function in tidyr. Before we proceed with reshaping our data, we will discuss how to read data stored in CSV format into R as a data frame. 4.3 Importing CSVs via readr Up to this point, we’ve used data either stored inside of an R package or we’ve manually created the data such as the fruits and fruits_counted data in Subsection 3.8. Another common way to get data into R is via reading in data from a spreadsheet either stored on your computer or stored online. For our purposes here, we will work with downloading data stored online. First, let’s download a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file of ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992: http://ismayc.github.io/dem_score.csv. After downloading it open it and take a look. You can think of a CSV file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where: Each line in the file corresponds to a row of data/one observation. Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas. The first line is usually a header row indicating the names of the columns/variables. As opposed to a bare-bones CSV file, Excel files contain a lot of metadata, or put more simply, data about the data. Examples include the used of bold and italic fonts, colored cells, different column widths, etc. However, going forward we will only avail ourselves of just the data, and not the metadata, as saved in a CSV file. There are many ways to read in this data into RStudio. Here are two of the simplest; for the purposes of practice, we suggest you try both. First, we can use the read_csv() function from the readr package to read in the data directly off the web: dem_score &lt;- read_csv(&quot;http://ismayc.github.io/dem_score.csv&quot;) dem_score Second, let’s read in the same data, but using the file you just downloaded on to your computer: Go to the Files pane of RStudio -&gt; Navigate the directories to where your downloaded files are -&gt; Right click dem_score.csv -&gt; Click “Import Dataset…” -&gt; Click “Import”. You’ll see two things happen: The RStudio Viewer will pop open with your data. In the console, the command that read-in the data will run. You can copy and paste this code to reload your data again later. In this dem_score data frame, the minimum value of -10 corresponds to a highly autocratic nation whereas a value of 10 corresponds to a highly democratic nation. Note also that backticks surround the different names of the columns here. Variable names are not allowed to start with a number but this can be worked around by surrounding the column name in backticks. Variable names also can’t include spaces so if you’d like to refer to the variable Stock Names above, for example, you’ll need to surround it in backticks: `Stock Names`. 4.4 Converting from wide to long Let’s focus on only the data corresponding to the country of Guatemala. guat_dem &lt;- dem_score %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;Guatemala&quot;) guat_dem Now let’s produce a plot showing how the democracy scores have changed over the 40 years from 1952 to 1992 for Guatemala. Let’s start by laying out how we would map our aesthetics to variables in the data frame: The data frame is guat_dem by setting data = guat_dem What are the names of the variables to plot? We’d like to see how the democracy score has changed over the years. Now we are stuck in a predicament. We see that we have a variable named country but its only value is &quot;Guatemala&quot;. We have other variables denoted by different year values. Unfortunately, we’ve run into a dataset that is not in the appropriate format to apply the Grammar of Graphics and ggplot2. Remember that ggplot2 is a package in the tidyverse and, thus, needs data to be in a tidy format. We’d like to finish off our mapping of aesthetics to variables by doing something like The aesthetic mapping is set by aes(x = year, y = democracy_score) but this is not possible with our wide-formatted data. We need to take the values of the current column names in guat_dem (aside from country) and convert them into a new variable that will act as a key called year. Then, we’d like to take the numbers on the inside of the table and turn them into a column that will act as values called democracy_score. Our resulting data frame will have three columns: country, year, and democracy_score. The gather() function in the tidyr package can complete this task for us. The first argument to gather(), just as with ggplot2(), is the data argument where we specify which data frame we would like to tidy. The next two arguments to gather() are key and value, which specify what we’d like to call the new columns that convert our wide data into long format. Lastly, we include a specification for variables we’d like to NOT include in this tidying process using a -. guat_tidy &lt;- gather(data = guat_dem, key = year, value = democracy_score, - country) guat_tidy We can now create the plot to show how the democracy score of Guatemala changed from 1952 to 1992 using a linegraph and ggplot2. ggplot(data = guat_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = democracy_score)) + geom_line() geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic? Observe that the year variable in guat_tidy is stored as a character vector since we had to circumvent the naming rules in R by adding backticks around the different year columns in guat_dem. This is leading to ggplot not knowing exactly how to plot a line using a categorical variable. We can fix this by using the parse_number() function in the readr package and then specify the horizontal axis label to be &quot;year&quot;: ggplot(data = guat_tidy, mapping = aes(x = parse_number(year), y = democracy_score)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;year&quot;) Figure 4.2: Guatemala’s democracy score ratings from 1952 to 1992 We’ll see in Chapter 5 how we could use the mutate() function to change year to be a numeric variable instead after we have done our tidying. Notice now that the mappings of aesthetics to variables make sense in Figure 4.2: The data frame is guat_tidy by setting data = dem_score The x aesthetic is mapped to year The y aesthetic is mapped to democracy_score The geom_etry chosen is line Learning check (LC4.3) Convert the dem_score data frame into a tidy data frame and assign the name of dem_tidy to the resulting long-formatted data frame. (LC4.4) Read in the life expectancy data stored at http://ismayc.github.io/le_mess.csv and convert it to a tidy data frame. Learning Check Solutions (LC4.3) dem_tidy &lt;- gather(data = dem_score, key = year, value = democracy_score, - country) (LC4.4) life_expectancy &lt;- read_csv('http://ismayc.github.io/le_mess.csv') life_ex_tidy &lt;- gather(data = life_expectancy, key = year, value = life_expectancy, -country) dem_tidy &lt;- gather(data = dem_score, key = year, value = democracy_score, - country) life_expectancy &lt;- read_csv('http://ismayc.github.io/le_mess.csv') life_ex_tidy &lt;- gather(data = life_expectancy, key = year, value = life_expectancy, -country) 4.5 Optional: Normal forms of data The datasets included in the nycflights13 package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data. We will see that there are ways to merge (or join) the different tables together easily. We are capable of doing so because each of the tables have keys in common to relate one to another. This is an important property of normal forms of data. The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called normalization. More information is available on Wikipedia. We saw an example of this above with the airlines dataset. While the flights data frame could also include a column with the names of the airlines instead of the carrier code, this would be repetitive since there is a unique mapping of the carrier code to the name of the airline/carrier. Below an example is given showing how to join the airlines data frame together with the flights data frame by linking together the two datasets via a common key of &quot;carrier&quot;. Note that this “joined” data frame is assigned to a new data frame called joined_flights. The key variable that we frequently join by is one of the identification variables mentioned above. library(dplyr) joined_flights &lt;- inner_join(x = flights, y = airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(joined_flights) If we View this dataset, we see a new variable has been created called name. (We will see in Subsection 5.9.2 ways to change name to a more descriptive variable name.) More discussion about joining data frames together will be given in Chapter 5. We will see there that the names of the columns to be linked need not match as they did here with &quot;carrier&quot;. Learning check (LC4.5) What are common characteristics of “tidy” datasets? (LC4.6) What makes “tidy” datasets useful for organizing data? (LC4.7) What are some advantages of data in normal forms? What are some disadvantages? Learning Check Solutions (LC4.5) What are common characteristics of “tidy” datasets? Rows correspond to observations, while columns correspond to variables. (LC4.6) What makes “tidy” datasets useful for organizing data? Tidy datasets are an organized way of viewing data. We’ll see later that this format is required for the ggplot2 and dplyr packages for data visualization and wrangling. (LC4.7) When datasets are in normal form, we can easily _join them with other datasets! For example, can we join the flights data with the planes data? We’ll see this more in Chapter 5! 4.6 Conclusion 4.6.1 Review questions Review questions have been designed using the fivethirtyeight R package (Kim, Ismay, and Chunn 2018) with links to the corresponding FiveThirtyEight.com articles in our free DataCamp course Effective Data Storytelling using the tidyverse. The material in this chapter is covered in the Tidy Data chapter of the DataCamp course available here. 4.6.2 What’s to come? In Chapter 5, we’ll further explore data in tidy format by grouping our data, creating summaries based on those groupings, filtering our data to match conditions, and performing other wranglings with our data including defining new columns/variables. These data wrangling procedures will go hand-in-hand with the data visualizations you’ve produced in Chapter 3. 4.6.3 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here.

In Chapter 4, we discussed what it means for data to be tidy. We saw that this refers to observations corresponding to rows and variables being stored in columns (one variable for every column). The entries in the data frame correspond to different combinations of observations (specific instances of observational units) and variables. In the flights data frame, we saw that each row corresponds to a different flight leaving New York City. In other words, the observational unit of the flights tidy data frame is a flight. The variables are listed as columns, and for flights these columns include both quantitative variables like dep_delay and distance and also categorical variables like carrier and origin. An entry in the table corresponds to a particular flight on a given day and a particular value of a given variable representing that flight. Armed with this knowledge and looking back on Chapter 3, we see that organizing data in this tidy way makes it easy for us to produce graphics, specifically a set of 5 common graphics we termed the 5 Named Graphics (5NG): scatterplots linegraphs boxplots histograms barplots We can simply specify what variable/column we would like on one axis, (if applicable) what variable we’d like on the other axis, and what type of plot we’d like to make by specifying the geometric object in question. We can also vary aesthetic attributes of the geometric objects in question (points, lines, bar), such as the size and color, along the values of another variable in this tidy dataset. Recall the Gapminder example from Figure 3.1. Lastly, in a few spots in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, we hinted at some ways to summarize and wrangle data to suit your needs, using the filter() and inner_join() functions. This chapter expands on these functions by giving a variety of examples using what we term the Five Main Verbs (5MV) in the dplyr package (Wickham, François, et al. 2018). Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(nycflights13) 5.1 The pipe %&gt;% Before we introduce the five main verbs, we first introduce the pipe operator (%&gt;%). Just as the + sign was used to add layers to a plot created using ggplot(), the pipe operator allows us to chain together dplyr data wrangling functions. The pipe operator can be read as “then”. The %&gt;% operator allows us to go from one step in dplyr to the next easily so we can, for example: filter our data frame to only focus on a few rows then group_by another variable to create groups then summarize this grouped data to calculate the mean for each level of the group. The piping syntax will be our major focus throughout the rest of this book and you’ll find that you’ll quickly be addicted to the chaining with some practice. 5.2 Five Main Verbs - The 5MV The d in dplyr stands for data frames, so the functions in dplyr are built for working with objects of the data frame type. For now, we focus on the 5MV: the five most commonly used functions that help wrangle and summarize data. A description of these verbs follows, with each section devoted to an example of that verb, or a combination of a few verbs, in action. filter(): Pick rows based on conditions about their values summarize(): Compute summary measures known as “summary statistics” of variables group_by(): Group rows of observations together mutate(): Create a new variable in the data frame by mutating existing ones arrange(): Arrange/sort the rows based on one or more variables Just as we had the Five Named Graphs for data visualization using ggplot2 in Chapter 3, we have the 5MV here (The Five Main Verbs in dplyr) for data wrangling. All of the 5MVs follow the same syntax, with the argument before the pipe %&gt;% being the name of the data frame, then the name of the verb, followed with other arguments specifying which criteria you’d like the verb to work with in parentheses. Keep in mind, there are more advanced functions than just these five and you’ll see some examples of this near the end of this chapter in 5.9, but with the 5MV you’ll be able to perform a broad array of data wrangling tasks. 5.3 5MV#1: Filter observations using filter Figure 5.1: Filter diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet The filter function here works much like the “Filter” option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about values of a variable in your dataset and then chooses only those rows that match that criteria. We begin by focusing only on flights from New York City to Portland, Oregon. The dest code (or airport code) for Portland, Oregon is &quot;PDX&quot;. Run the following and look at the resulting spreadsheet to ensure that only flights heading to Portland are chosen here: portland_flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(dest == &quot;PDX&quot;) View(portland_flights) Note the following: The ordering of the commands: Take the data frame flights then filter the data frame so that only those where the dest equals &quot;PDX&quot; are included. The double equal sign == for testing for equality, and not =. You are almost guaranteed to make the mistake at least once of only including one equals sign. You can combine multiple criteria together using operators that make comparisons: | corresponds to “or” &amp; corresponds to “and” We can often skip the use of &amp; and just separate our conditions with a comma. You’ll see this in the example below. In addition, you can use other mathematical checks (similar to ==): &gt; corresponds to “greater than” &lt; corresponds to “less than” &gt;= corresponds to “greater than or equal to” &lt;= corresponds to “less than or equal to” != corresponds to “not equal to” To see many of these in action, let’s select all flights that left JFK airport heading to Burlington, Vermont (&quot;BTV&quot;) or Seattle, Washington (&quot;SEA&quot;) in the months of October, November, or December. Run the following btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(origin == &quot;JFK&quot;, (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;), month &gt;= 10) View(btv_sea_flights_fall) Note: even though colloquially speaking one might say “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont and Seattle, Washington,” in terms of computer logical operations, we really mean “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont or Seattle, Washington.” For a given row in the data, dest can be “BTV”, “SEA”, or something else, but not “BTV” and “SEA” at the same time. Another example uses the ! to pick rows that don’t match a condition. The ! can be read as “not”. Here we are selecting rows corresponding to flights that didn’t go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA. not_BTV_SEA &lt;- flights %&gt;% filter(!(dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;)) View(not_BTV_SEA) As a final note we point out that filter() should often be the first verb you’ll apply to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about, or put differently, it narrows down the scope to just the observations your care about. Learning check (LC5.1) What’s another way using the “not” operator ! we could filter only the rows that are not going to Burlington, VT nor Seattle, WA in the flights data frame? Test this out using the code above. Learning Check Solutions (LC5.1) What’s another way using the “not” operator ! we could filter only the rows that are not going to Burlington, VT nor Seattle, WA in the flights data frame?

While this may seem like a very abstract idea, something as simple as the sum, the smallest value, and the largest values are all summaries of a large number of values. Figure 5.2: Summarize diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet Figure 5.3: Another summarize diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet We can calculate the standard deviation and mean of the temperature variable temp in the weather data frame of nycflights13 in one step using the summarize (or equivalently using the UK spelling summarise) function in dplyr (See Appendix A): summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp), std_dev = sd(temp)) summary_temp mean std_dev NA NA We’ve created a small data frame here called summary_temp that includes both the mean and the std_dev of the temp variable in weather. Notice as shown in Figures 5.2 and 5.3, the data frame weather went from many rows to a single row of just the summary values in the data frame summary_temp. But why are the values returned NA? This stands for “not available or not applicable” and is how R encodes missing values; if in a data frame for a particular row and column no value exists, NA is stored instead. Furthermore, by default any time you try to summarize a number of values (using mean() and sd() for example) that has one or more missing values, then NA is returned. Values can be missing for many reasons. Perhaps the data was collected but someone forgot to enter it? Perhaps the data was not collected at all because it was too difficult? Perhaps there was an erroneous value that someone entered that has been correct to read as missing? You’ll often encounter issues with missing values. You can summarize all non-missing values by setting the na.rm argument to TRUE (rm is short for “remove”). This will remove any NA missing values and only return the summary value for all non-missing values. So the code below computes the mean and standard deviation of all non-missing values. Notice how the na.rm=TRUE are set as arguments to the mean() and sd() functions, and not to the summarize() function. summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_temp mean std_dev 55.20351 17.78212 It is not good practice to include a na.rm = TRUE in your summary commands by default; you should attempt to run them without this argument. This is because removing missing data can have an impact on your analyses. In fact, an entire branch of the field of statistics deals with missing data. The take away point is that na.rm = TRUE should only be used after you become aware of the implications of its use (see the Learning Checks below for an example). What other summary functions can we use inside the summarize() verb? Any function in R that takes a vector of values and returns just one. Here are just a few: mean(): the mean AKA the average sd(): the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread min() and max(): the minimum and maximum values respectively IQR(): Interquartile range sum(): the sum n(): a count of the number of rows/observations in each group. This particular summary function will make more sense when group_by() is covered in Section 5.5. Learning check (LC5.2) Say a doctor is studying the effect of smoking on lung cancer for a large number of patients who have records measured at five year intervals. She notices that a large number of patients have missing data points because the patient has died, so she chooses to ignore these patients in her analysis. What is wrong with this doctor’s approach? (LC5.3) Modify the above summarize function to create summary_temp to also use the n() summary function: summarize(count = n()). What does the returned value correspond to? (LC5.4) Why doesn’t the following code work? Run the code line by line instead of all at once, and then look at the data. In other words, run summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) first. summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% summarize(std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) Learning Check Solutions (LC5.2) A doctor is studying the effect of smoking on lung cancer for a large number of patients who have records measured at five year intervals. They notice that a large number of patients have missing data points because the patient has died, so they choose to ignore these patients in their analysis. What is wrong with this doctor’s approach? The missing patients may have died of lung cancer! So to ignore them might seriously bias your results! It is very important to think of what the consequences on your analysis are of ignoring missing data! Ask yourself: + There is a systematic reasons why certain values are missing? If so, you might be biasing your results! + If there isn’t, then it might be ok to “sweep missing values under the rug.” (LC5.3) Modify the above summarize function to create summary_temp to also use the n() summary function: summarize(count = n()). What does the returned value correspond to? It corresponds to a count of the number of observations/rows: weather %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) (LC5.4) Why doesn’t the following code work? summary_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% summarize(std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) Consider the output of only running the first two lines: weather %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) Because after the first summarize(), the variable temp disappears as it has been collapsed to the value mean. So when we try to run the second summarize(), it can’t find the variable temp` to compute the standard deviation of. 5.5 5MV#3: Group rows using group_by Figure 5.4: Group by and summarize diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet It’s often more useful to summarize a variable based on the groupings of another variable. Let’s say, we are interested in the mean and standard deviation of temperatures but grouped by month. To be more specific: we want the mean and standard deviation of temperatures split by month. sliced by month. aggregated by month. collapsed over month. Run the following code: summary_monthly_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_monthly_temp month mean std_dev 1 35.64127 10.185459 2 34.15454 6.940228 3 39.81404 6.224948 4 51.67094 8.785250 5 61.59185 9.608687 6 72.14500 7.603357 7 80.00967 7.147631 8 74.40495 5.171365 9 67.42582 8.475824 10 60.03305 8.829652 11 45.10893 10.502249 12 38.36811 9.940822 This code is identical to the previous code that created summary_temp, with an extra group_by(month) added. Grouping the weather dataset by month and then passing this new data frame into summarize yields a data frame that shows the mean and standard deviation of temperature for each month in New York City. Note: Since each row in summary_monthly_temp represents a summary of different rows in weather, the observational units have changed. It is important to note that group_by doesn’t change the data frame. It sets meta-data (data about the data), specifically the group structure of the data. It is only after we apply the summarize function that the data frame changes. If we would like to remove this group structure meta-data, we can pipe the resulting data frame into the ungroup() function. For example, say the group structure meta-data is set to be by month via group_by(month), all future summarizations will be reported on a month-by-month basis. If however, we would like to no longer have this and have all summarizations be for all data in a single group (in this case over the entire year of 2013), then pipe the data frame in question through and ungroup() to remove this. We now revisit the n() counting summary function we introduced in the previous section. For example, suppose we’d like to get a sense for how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City: by_origin &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(origin) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) by_origin origin count EWR 120835 JFK 111279 LGA 104662 We see that Newark (&quot;EWR&quot;) had the most flights departing in 2013 followed by &quot;JFK&quot; and lastly by LaGuardia (&quot;LGA&quot;). Note there is a subtle but important difference between sum() and n(). While sum() simply adds up a large set of numbers, the latter counts the number of times each of many different values occur. 5.5.1 Grouping by more than one variable You are not limited to grouping by one variable! Say you wanted to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports for each month, we can also group by a second variable month: group_by(origin, month). by_origin_monthly &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(origin, month) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) by_origin_monthly We see there are 36 rows to by_origin_monthly because there are 12 months times 3 airports (EWR, JFK, and LGA). Let’s now pose two questions. First, what if we reverse the order of the grouping i.e. we group_by(month, origin)? by_monthly_origin &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(month, origin) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) by_monthly_origin In by_monthly_origin the month column is now first and the rows are sorted by month instead of origin. If you compare the values of count in by_origin_monthly and by_monthly_origin using the View() function, you’ll see that the values are actually the same, just presented in a different order. Second, why do we group_by(origin, month) and not group_by(origin) and then group_by(month)? Let’s investigate: by_origin_monthly_incorrect &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(origin) %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) by_origin_monthly_incorrect What happened here is that the second group_by(month) overrode the first group_by(origin), so that in the end we are only grouping by month. The lesson here, is if you want to group_by() two or more variables, you should include all these variables in a single group_by() function call.

We see that the period in November, December, and January has the most variation in weather, so you can expect very different temperatures on different days. (LC5.6) What code would be required to get the mean and standard deviation temperature for each day in 2013 for NYC? summary_temp_by_day &lt;- weather %&gt;% group_by(year, month, day) %&gt;% summarize( mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE) ) summary_temp_by_day Note: group_by(day) is not enough, because day is a value between 1-31.

We could summarize the count from each airport using the n() function, which counts rows. count_flights_by_airport &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(origin, carrier) %&gt;% summarize(count=n()) count_flights_by_airport origin carrier count EWR 9E 1268 EWR AA 3487 EWR AS 714 EWR B6 6557 EWR DL 4342 EWR EV 43939 EWR MQ 2276 EWR OO 6 EWR UA 46087 EWR US 4405 EWR VX 1566 EWR WN 6188 JFK 9E 14651 JFK AA 13783 JFK B6 42076 JFK DL 20701 JFK EV 1408 JFK HA 342 JFK MQ 7193 JFK UA 4534 JFK US 2995 JFK VX 3596 LGA 9E 2541 LGA AA 15459 LGA B6 6002 LGA DL 23067 LGA EV 8826 LGA F9 685 LGA FL 3260 LGA MQ 16928 LGA OO 26 LGA UA 8044 LGA US 13136 LGA WN 6087 LGA YV 601 All remarkably similar! Note: the n() function counts rows, whereas the sum(VARIABLE_NAME) funciton sums all values of a certain numerical variable VARIABLE_NAME. (LC5.9) How does the filter operation differ from a group_by followed by a summarize? filter picks out rows from the original dataset without modifying them, whereas group_by %&gt;% summarize computes summaries of numerical variables, and hence reports new values. 5.6 5MV#4: Create new variables/change old variables using mutate Figure 5.5: Mutate diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet When looking at the flights dataset, there are some clear additional variables that could be calculated based on the values of variables already in the dataset. Passengers are often frustrated when their flights departs late, but change their mood a bit if pilots can make up some time during the flight to get them to their destination close to when they expected to land. This is commonly referred to as “gain” and we will create this variable using the mutate function. Note that we have also overwritten the flights data frame with what it was before as well as an additional variable gain here, or put differently, the mutate() command outputs a new data frame which then gets saved over the original flights data frame. flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay) Why did we overwrite flights instead of assigning the resulting data frame to a new object, like flights_with_gain? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing information that you might need later, it’s acceptable practice to overwrite data frames. However, if you overwrite existing variables and/or change the observational units, recovering the original information might prove difficult. In this case, it might make sense to create a new data object. Let’s look at summary measures of this gain variable and even plot it in the form of a histogram: gain_summary &lt;- flights %&gt;% summarize( min = min(gain, na.rm = TRUE), q1 = quantile(gain, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), median = quantile(gain, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE), q3 = quantile(gain, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), max = max(gain, na.rm = TRUE), mean = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(gain, na.rm = TRUE), missing = sum(is.na(gain)) ) gain_summary min q1 median q3 max mean sd missing -196 -3 7 17 109 5.659779 18.04365 9430 We’ve recreated the summary function we saw in Chapter 3 here using the summarize function in dplyr. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = gain)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) Figure 5.6: Histogram of gain variable We can also create multiple columns at once and even refer to columns that were just created in a new column. Hadley and Garrett produce one such example in Chapter 5 of “R for Data Science” (Grolemund and Wickham 2016): flights &lt;- flights %&gt;% mutate( gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, hours = air_time / 60, gain_per_hour = gain / hours ) Learning check (LC5.10) What do positive values of the gain variable in flights correspond to? What about negative values? And what about a zero value? (LC5.11) Could we create the dep_delay and arr_delay columns by simply subtracting dep_time from sched_dep_time and similarly for arrivals? Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in flights. (LC5.12) What can we say about the distribution of gain? Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the gain_summary data frame values. Learning Check Solutions (LC5.10) What do positive values of the gain variable in flights correspond to? What about negative values? And what about a zero value? Say a flight departed 20 minutes late, i.e. dep_delay = 20 Then arrived 10 minutes late, i.e. arr_delay = 10. Then gain = dep_delay - arr_delay = 20 - 10 = 10 is positive, so it “made up/gained time in the air”. 0 means the departure and arrival time were the same, so no time was made up in the air. We see in most cases that the gain is near 0 minutes. I never understood this. If the pilot says “we’re going make up time in the air” because of delay by flying faster, why don’t you always just fly faster to begin with? (LC5.11) Could we create the dep_delay and arr_delay columns by simply subtracting dep_time from sched_dep_time and similarly for arrivals? Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in flights. No because you can’t do direct arithmetic on times. The difference in time between 12:03 and 11:59 is 4 minutes, but 1203-1159 = 44 (LC5.12) What can we say about the distribution of gain? Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the gain_summary data frame values. Most of the time the gain is a little under zero, most of the time the gain is between -50 and 50 minutes. There are some extreme cases however! 5.7 5MV#5: Reorder the data frame using arrange One of the most common things people working with data would like to do is sort the data frames by a specific variable in a column. Have you ever been asked to calculate a median by hand? This requires you to put the data in order from smallest to highest in value. The dplyr package has a function called arrange that we will use to sort/reorder our data according to the values of the specified variable. This is often used after we have used the group_by and summarize functions as we will see. Let’s suppose we were interested in determining the most frequent destination airports from New York City in 2013: freq_dest &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% summarize(num_flights = n()) freq_dest You’ll see that by default the values of dest are displayed in alphabetical order here. We are interested in finding those airports that appear most: freq_dest %&gt;% arrange(num_flights) This is actually giving us the opposite of what we are looking for. It tells us the least frequent destination airports first. To switch the ordering to be descending instead of ascending we use the desc (descending) function: freq_dest %&gt;% arrange(desc(num_flights)) 5.8 Joining data frames Another common task is joining/merging two different datasets. For example, in the flights data, the variable carrier lists the carrier code for the different flights. While &quot;UA&quot; and &quot;AA&quot; might be somewhat easy to guess for some (United and American Airlines), what are “VX”, “HA”, and “B6”? This information is provided in a separate data frame airlines. View(airlines) We see that in airports, carrier is the carrier code while name is the full name of the airline. Using this table, we can see that “VX”, “HA”, and “B6” correspond to Virgin America, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue respectively. However, will we have to continually look up the carrier’s name for each flight in the airlines dataset? No! Instead of having to do this manually, we can have R automatically do the “looking up” for us. Note that the values in the variable carrier in flights match the values in the variable carrier in airlines. In this case, we can use the variable carrier as a key variable to join/merge/match the two data frames by. Hadley and Garrett (Grolemund and Wickham 2016) created the following diagram to help us understand how the different datasets are linked: Figure 5.7: Data relationships in nycflights13 from R for Data Science 5.8.1 Joining by key variables In both flights and airlines, the key variable we want to join/merge/match the two data frames with has the same name in both datasets: carriers. We make use of the inner_join() function to join by the variable carrier. flights_joined &lt;- flights %&gt;% inner_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(flights) View(flights_joined) We observed that the flights and flights_joined are identical except that flights_joined has an additional variable name whose values were drawn from airlines. A visual representation of the inner_join is given below (Grolemund and Wickham 2016): Figure 5.8: Diagram of inner join from R for Data Science There are more complex joins available, but the inner_join will solve nearly all of the problems you’ll face in our experience. 5.8.2 Joining by key variables with different names Say instead, you are interested in all the destinations of flights from NYC in 2013 and ask yourself: “What cities are these airports in?” “Is &quot;ORD&quot; Orlando?” “Where is &quot;FLL&quot;? The airports data frame contains airport codes: View(airports) However, looking at both the airports and flights and the visual representation of the relations between the data frames in Figure 5.8, we see that in: airports the airport code is in the variable faa flights the airport code is in the variable origin So to join these two datasets, our inner_join operation involves a by argument that accounts for the different names: flights %&gt;% inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) Let’s construct the sequence of commands that computes the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also includes information about each destination airport: named_dests &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% summarize(num_flights = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(num_flights)) %&gt;% inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) %&gt;% rename(airport_name = name) View(named_dests) In case you didn’t know, &quot;ORD&quot; is the airport code of Chicago O’Hare airport and &quot;FLL&quot; is the main airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which we can now see in our named_dests data frame. Learning check (LC5.13) Looking at Figure 5.7, when joining flights and weather (or, in other words, matching the hourly weather values with each flight), why do we need to join by all of year, month, day, hour, and origin, and not just hour?

(LC5.14) What surprises you about the top 10 destinations from NYC in 2013? This question is subjective! What surprises me is the high number of flights to Boston. Wouldn’t it be easier and quicker to take the train? 5.9 Optional: Other verbs On top of the following examples of other verbs, if you’d like to see more examples on using dplyr, the 5MV, and %&gt;% with the nycflights13 dataset, check out Chapter 5 of Hadley and Garrett’s book (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). 5.9.1 Select variables using select Figure 5.9: Select diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet We’ve seen that the flights data frame in the nycflights13 package contains many different variables. The names function gives a listing of all the columns in a data frame; in our case you would run names(flights). You can also identify these variables by running the glimpse function in the dplyr package: glimpse(flights) However, say you only want to consider two of these variables, say carrier and flight. You can select these: flights %&gt;% select(carrier, flight) Another one of these variables is year. If you remember the original description of the flights data frame (or by running ?flights), you’ll remember that this data correspond to flights in 2013 departing New York City. The year variable isn’t really a variable here in that it doesn’t vary… flights actually comes from a larger dataset that covers many years. We may want to remove the year variable from our dataset since it won’t be helpful for analysis in this case. We can deselect year by using the - sign: flights_no_year &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(-year) names(flights_no_year) Or we could specify a ranges of columns: flight_arr_times &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(month:day, arr_time:sched_arr_time) flight_arr_times The select function can also be used to reorder columns in combination with the everything helper function. Let’s suppose we’d like the hour, minute, and time_hour variables, which appear at the end of the flights dataset, to actually appear immediately after the day variable: flights_reorder &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(month:day, hour:time_hour, everything()) names(flights_reorder) in this case everything() picks up all remaining variables. Lastly, the helper functions starts_with, ends_with, and contains can be used to choose column names that match those conditions: flights_begin_a &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(starts_with(&quot;a&quot;)) flights_begin_a flights_delays &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(ends_with(&quot;delay&quot;)) flights_delays flights_time &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;time&quot;)) flights_time 5.9.2 Rename variables using rename Another useful function is rename, which as you may suspect renames one column to another name. Suppose we wanted dep_time and arr_time to be departure_time and arrival_time instead in the flights_time data frame: flights_time_new &lt;- flights %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;time&quot;)) %&gt;% rename(departure_time = dep_time, arrival_time = arr_time) names(flights_time) Note that in this case we used a single = sign with the rename(). Ex: departure_time = dep_time. This is because we are not testing for equality like we would using ==, but instead we want to assign a new variable departure_time to have the same values as dep_time and then delete the variable dep_time. It’s easy to forget if the new name comes before or after the equals sign. I usually remember this as “New Before, Old After” or NBOA. You’ll receive an error if you try to do it the other way: Error: Unknown variables: departure_time, arrival_time. 5.9.3 Find the top number of values using top_n We can also use the top_n function which automatically tells us the most frequent num_flights. We specify the top 10 airports here: named_dests %&gt;% top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) We’ll still need to arrange this by num_flights though: named_dests %&gt;% top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) %&gt;% arrange(desc(num_flights)) Note: Remember that I didn’t pull the n and wt arguments out of thin air. They can be found by using the ? function on top_n. We can go one stop further and tie together the group_by and summarize functions we used to find the most frequent flights: ten_freq_dests &lt;- flights %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% summarize(num_flights = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(num_flights)) %&gt;% top_n(n = 10) View(ten_freq_dests) Learning check (LC5.15) What are some ways to select all three of the dest, air_time, and distance variables from flights?

The material in this chapter is covered in the chapters of the DataCamp course available below: Filtering, Grouping, &amp; Summarizing dplyr Review 5.10.2 What’s to come? Congratulations! We’ve completed the “data science” portion of this book! We’ll now move to the “data modeling” portion in Chapters 6 and 7, where you’ll leverage your data visualization and wrangling skills to model the relationships between different variables of datasets. However, we’re going to leave “Inference for Regression” (Chapter 11) until later. 5.10.3 Resources As we saw with the RStudio cheatsheet on data visualization, RStudio has also created a cheatsheet for data wrangling entitled “Data Transformation with dplyr”. 5.10.4 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here.

The fundamental premise of data modeling is to make explicit the relationship between: an outcome variable \\(y\\), also called a dependent variable and an explanatory/predictor variable \\(x\\), also called an independent variable or covariate. Another way to state this is using mathematical terminology: we will model the outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of the explanatory/predictor variable \\(x\\). Why do we have two different labels, explanatory and predictor, for the variable \\(x\\)? That’s because roughly speaking data modeling can be used for two purposes: Modeling for prediction: You want to predict an outcome variable \\(y\\) based on the information contained in a set of predictor variables. You don’t care so much about understanding how all the variables relate and interact, but so long as you can make good predictions about \\(y\\), you’re fine. For example, if we know many individuals’ risk factors for lung cancer, such as smoking habits and age, can we predict whether or not they will develop lung cancer? Here we wouldn’t care so much about distinguishing the degree to which the different risk factors contribute to lung cancer, but instead only on whether or not they could be put together to make reliable predictions. Modeling for explanation: You want to explicitly describe the relationship between an outcome variable \\(y\\) and a set of explanatory variables, determine the significance of any found relationships, and have measures summarizing these. Continuing our example from above, we would now be interested in describing the individual effects of the different risk factors and quantifying the magnitude of these effects. One reason could be to design an intervention to reduce lung cancer cases in a population, such as targeting smokers of a specific age group with an advertisement for smoking cessation programs. In this book, we’ll focus more on this latter purpose. Data modeling is used in a wide variety of fields, including statistical inference, causal inference, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. There are many techniques for data modeling, such as tree-based models, neural networks and deep learning, and supervised learning. In this chapter, we’ll focus on one particular technique: linear regression, one of the most commonly-used and easy-to-understand approaches to modeling. Recall our discussion in Subsection 2.4.3 on numerical and categorical variables. Linear regression involves: an outcome variable \\(y\\) that is numerical and explanatory variables \\(\\vec{x}\\) that are either numerical or categorical. With linear regression there is always only one numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) but we have choices on both the number and the type of explanatory variables \\(\\vec{x}\\) to use. We’re going to cover the following regression scenarios: In this current chapter on basic regression, we’ll always have only one explanatory variable. In Section 6.1, this explanatory variable will be a single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\). This scenario is known as simple linear regression. In Section 6.2, this explanatory variable will be a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\). In the next chapter, Chapter 7 on multiple regression, we’ll have more than one explanatory variable: We’ll focus on two numerical explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in Section 7.1. This can be denoted as \\(\\vec{x}\\) as well since we have more than one explanatory variable. We’ll use one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable in Section 7.1. We’ll also introduce interaction models here; there, the effect of one explanatory variable depends on the value of another. We’ll study all four of these regression scenarios using real data, all easily accessible via R packages! Needed packages In this chapter we introduce a new package, moderndive, that is an accompaniment package to this ModernDive book. It includes useful functions for linear regression and other functions as well as data used later in the book. Let’s now load all the packages needed for this chapter. If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(gapminder) 6.1 One numerical explanatory variable Why do some professors and instructors at universities and colleges get high teaching evaluations from students while others don’t? What factors can explain these differences? Are there biases? These are questions that are of interest to university/college administrators, as teaching evaluations are among the many criteria considered in determining which professors and instructors should get promotions. Researchers at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas (UT Austin) tried to answer this question: what factors can explain differences in instructor’s teaching evaluation scores? To this end, they collected information on \\(n = 463\\) instructors. A full description of the study can be found at openintro.org. We’ll keep things simple for now and try to explain differences in instructor evaluation scores as a function of one numerical variable: their “beauty score.” The specifics on how this score was calculated will be described shortly. Could it be that instructors with higher beauty scores also have higher teaching evaluations? Could it be instead that instructors with higher beauty scores tend to have lower teaching evaluations? Or could it be there is no relationship between beauty score and teaching evaluations? We’ll achieve ways to address these questions by modeling the relationship between these two variables with a particular kind of linear regression called simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is the most basic form of linear regression. With it we have A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\). In this case, their teaching score. A single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\). In this case, their beauty score. 6.1.1 Exploratory data analysis A crucial step before doing any kind of modeling or analysis is performing an exploratory data analysis, or EDA, of all our data. Exploratory data analysis can give you a sense of the distribution of the data, and whether there are outliers and/or missing values. Most importantly, it can inform how to build your model. There are many approaches to exploratory data analysis; here are three: Most fundamentally: just looking at the raw values, in a spreadsheet for example. While this may seem trivial, many people ignore this crucial step! Computing summary statistics likes means, medians, and standard deviations. Creating data visualizations. Let’s load the data, select only a subset of the variables, and look at the raw values. Recall you can look at the raw values by running View() in the console in RStudio to pop-up the spreadsheet viewer with the data frame of interest as the argument to View(). Here, however, we present only a snapshot of five randomly chosen rows: evals_small &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, bty_avg, age) evals_small %&gt;% sample_n(5) Table 6.1: Random sample of 5 instructors score bty_avg age 3.6 6.67 34 4.9 3.50 43 3.3 2.33 47 4.4 4.67 33 4.7 3.67 60 While a full description of each of these variables can be found at openintro.org, let’s summarize what each of these variables represents. score: Numerical variable of the average teaching score based on students’ evaluations between 1 and 5. This is the outcome variable \\(y\\) of interest. bty_avg: Numerical variable of average “beauty” rating based on a panel of 6 students’ scores between 1 and 10. This is the numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) of interest. Here 1 corresponds to a low beauty rating and 10 to a high beauty rating. age: A numerical variable of age in years as an integer value. Another way to look at the raw values is using the glimpse() function, which gives us a slightly different view of the data. We see Observations: 463, indicating that there are 463 observations in evals, each corresponding to a particular instructor at UT Austin. Expressed differently, each row in the data frame evals corresponds to one of 463 instructors. glimpse(evals_small) Observations: 463 Variables: 3 $ score &lt;dbl&gt; 4.7, 4.1, 3.9, 4.8, 4.6, 4.3, 2.8, 4.1, 3.4, 4.5, 3.8, 4.5,... $ bty_avg &lt;dbl&gt; 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.33, 3.33, 3.17,... $ age &lt;int&gt; 36, 36, 36, 36, 59, 59, 59, 51, 51, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40,... Since both the outcome variable score and the explanatory variable bty_avg are numerical, we can compute summary statistics about them such as the mean and median. Let’s take evals_small, then select only the two variables of interest for now, and pipe them into the summary() command. For each of these two variables, it returns the minimum (smallest) value, the first quartile, the median, the mean (average), the third quartile, and the maximum (largest) value. evals_small %&gt;% select(score, bty_avg) %&gt;% summary() score bty_avg Min. :2.30 Min. :1.67 1st Qu.:3.80 1st Qu.:3.17 Median :4.30 Median :4.33 Mean :4.17 Mean :4.42 3rd Qu.:4.60 3rd Qu.:5.50 Max. :5.00 Max. :8.17 We get an idea of how the values in both variables are distributed. For example, the mean teaching score was 4.17 out of 5 whereas the mean beauty score was 4.42 out of 10. Furthermore, the middle 50% of teaching scores were between 3.80 and 4.6 (the first and third quartiles) while the middle 50% of beauty scores were between 3.17 and 5.5 out of 10. The summary() function however only returns what are called univariate summaries, i.e. summaries about single variables at a time. Since we are considering the relationship between two numerical variables, it would be nice to have a summary statistic that simultaneously considers both variables. The correlation coefficient is a bivariate summary statistic that fits this bill. Coefficients in general are quantitative expressions of a specific property of a phenomenon. A correlation coefficient is a quantitative expression between -1 and 1 that summarizes the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables: -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship: as the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go down. 0 indicates no relationship: the values of both variables go up/down independently of each other. +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship: as the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go up as well. Figure 6.1 gives examples of different correlation coefficient values for hypothetical numerical variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We see that while for a correlation coefficient of -0.75 there is still a negative relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), it is not as strong as the negative relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when the correlation coefficient is -1. Figure 6.1: Different correlation coefficients The correlation coefficient is computed using the get_correlation() function in the moderndive package, where in this case the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables from which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. We place the name of the response variable on the left hand side of the ~ and the explanatory variable on the right hand side of the “tilde.” We will use this same “formula” syntax with regression later in this chapter. evals_small %&gt;% get_correlation(formula = score ~ bty_avg) The correlation coefficient can also be computed using the cor() function, where in this case the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables from which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. Recall from Subsection 2.4.3 that the $ pulls out specific variables from a data frame: cor(x = evals_small$bty_avg, y = evals_small$score) [1] 0.187 In our case, the correlation coefficient of 0.187 indicates that the relationship between teaching evaluation score and beauty average is “weakly positive.” There is a certain amount of subjectivity in interpreting correlation coefficients, especially those that aren’t close to -1, 0, and 1. For help developing such intuition and more discussion on the correlation coefficient see Subsection 6.3.1 below. Let’s now proceed by visualizing this data. Since both the score and bty_avg variables are numerical, a scatterplot is an appropriate graph to visualize this data. Let’s do this using geom_point() and set informative axes labels and title. ggplot(evals_small, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of teaching and beauty scores&quot;) Figure 6.2: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin However Figure 6.2 suffers from overplotting. Recall from the data visualization Subsection 3.3.2 that overplotting occurs when several points are stacked directly on top of each other thereby obscuring the number of points. For example, let’s focus on the 6 points in the top-right of the plot with a beauty score of around 8 out of 10: are there truly only 6 points, or are there many more just stacked on top of each other? You can think of these as ties. Let’s break up these ties with a little random “jitter” added to the points in Figure 6.3. Jittering adds a little random bump to each of the points to break up these ties. Remember that the geom_jitter only alters the visual display of the points; the values in the data frame stay the same. ggplot(evals_small, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_jitter() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of teaching and beauty scores&quot;) Figure 6.3: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin: Jittered From Figure 6.3 we make several observations: Focusing our attention on the top-right of the plot again, we now see that those originally unjittered 6 points actually were actually 12! A further interesting trend is that the jittering revealed a large number of instructors with beauty scores of between 3 and 4.5, towards the lower end of the beauty scale. Most beauty scores lie between 2 and 8. Most teaching scores lie between 3 and 5. Recall our earlier computation of the correlation coefficient, which describes the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. Looking at Figure 6.3, it is not immediately apparent that these two variables are positively related. This is to be expected given the positive, but rather weak (close to 0), correlation coefficient of 0.187. Going back to the unjittered plot in Figure 6.2, let’s improve on it by adding a “regression line” in Figure 6.4. This is easily done by adding a new layer to the ggplot code that created Figure 6.3: + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;). A regression line is a “best fitting” line in that of all possible lines you could draw on this plot, it is “best” in terms of some mathematical criteria. We discuss the criteria for “best” in Subsection 6.3.3 below, but we suggest you read this only after covering the concept of a residual coming up in Subsection 6.1.3. ggplot(evals_small, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of teaching and beauty scores&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) Figure 6.4: Regression line When viewed on this plot, the regression line is a visual summary of the relationship between two numerical variables, in our case the outcome variable score and the explanatory variable bty_avg. The positive slope of the blue line is consistent with our observed correlation coefficient of 0.187 suggesting that there is a positive relationship between score and bty_avg. We’ll see later however that while the correlation coefficient is not equal to the slope of this line, they always have the same sign: positive or negative. What are the grey bands surrounding the blue line? These are standard error bands, which can be thought of as error/uncertainty bands. Let’s skip this idea for now and suppress these grey bars for now by adding the argument se = FALSE to geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;). We’ll introduce standard errors in Chapter 8 on sampling, use them for constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests in Chapters 9 and 10, and consider them when we revisit regression in Chapter 11. ggplot(evals_small, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of teaching and beauty scores&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) Figure 6.5: Regression line without error bands Learning check (LC6.1) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same outcome variable \\(y\\) being score but with age as the new explanatory variable \\(x\\). Remember, this involves three things: Looking at the raw values. Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest. Creating informative visualizations. What can you say about the relationship between age and teaching scores based on this exploration? 6.1.2 Simple linear regression You may recall from secondary school / high school algebra, in general, the equation of a line is \\(y = a + bx\\), which is defined by two coefficients. Recall we defined this earlier as “quantitative expressions of a specific property of a phenomenon.” These two coefficients are: the intercept coefficient \\(a\\), or the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\), and the slope coefficient \\(b\\), or the increase in \\(y\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). However, when defining a line specifically for regression, like the blue regression line in Figure 6.5, we use slightly different notation: the equation of the regression line is \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x\\) where the intercept coefficient is \\(b_0\\), or the value of \\(\\widehat{y}\\) when \\(x=0\\), and the slope coefficient \\(b_1\\), or the increase in \\(\\widehat{y}\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). Why do we put a “hat” on top of the \\(y\\)? It’s a form of notation commonly used in regression, which we’ll introduce in the next Subsection 6.1.3 when we discuss fitted values. For now, let’s ignore the hat and treat the equation of the line as you would from secondary school / high school algebra recognizing the slope and the intercept. We know looking at Figure 6.5 that the slope coefficient corresponding to bty_avg should be positive. Why? Because as bty_avg increases, professors tend to roughly have larger teaching evaluation scores. However, what are the specific values of the intercept and slope coefficients? Let’s not worry about computing these by hand, but instead let the computer do the work for us. Specifically let’s use R! Let’s get the value of the intercept and slope coefficients by outputting something called the linear regression table. This will be done in a two-step process: First “fit” the linear regression model to the data using the lm() function and save this to score_model. lm stands for “linear model”, given that we are dealing with lines. When we say “fit”, we are saying find the best fitting line to this data. Then apply the get_regression_table() function from the moderndive R package to score_model. score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_small) get_regression_table(score_model, digits = 3) Table 6.2: Linear regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 Whoa! There is a lot going on, both in terms of the inputs and outputs! Let’s unpack this slowly. First, the lm() function that “fits” the linear regression model is typically used as lm(y ~ x, data = DATA_FRAME_NAME) where: y is the outcome variable, followed by a tilde (~). This is likely the key to the left of “1” on your keyboard. In our case, y is set to score. x is the explanatory variable. In our case, x is set to bty_avg. We call the combination y ~ x a model formula. Recall the use of this notation when we computed the correlation coefficient using the get_correlation() function in Subsection @ref(#model1EDA). DATA_FRAME_NAME is the name of the data frame that contains the variables y and x. In our case, DATA_FRAME_NAME is the evals_small data frame. Then we take the saved model in score_model and apply the get_regression_table() function to it. This returns a cleanly formatted regression table. An additional argument to the get_regression_table() function is digits, where we specify the number of significant digits of precision (number of digits after the decimal points) we want the regression table to have. The digits argument defaults to 3, meaning if you don’t specify this argument, digits = 3 is used by default. All the get_regression_table() function in the moderndive package does is generate regression table outputs that are clean and easy-to-read while hiding a lot of the code necessary to do so and not much else. This is known as a wrapper function in computer programming, which takes other pre-existing functions and “wraps” them in a single function. While not necessary to understand regression, if you are curious to know what is going on under the hood of get_regression_table(), see Subsection 6.3.4 below. Now let’s consider the outputted regression table, which has two rows denoted by the first column term: one corresponding to the intercept coefficient \\(b_0\\) and one corresponding to the slope coefficient \\(b_1\\) for bty_avg. The second column estimate gives us the “fitted” (or computed) values for both these coefficients. Therefore the blue regression line in Figure 6.5 is \\(\\widehat{\\text{score}} = b_0 + b_{\\text{bty avg}} \\text{bty avg} = 3.88 + 0.067\\text{ bty avg}\\) where The intercept coefficient \\(b_0\\) is 3.88. Meaning for instructors that had a hypothetical beauty score of 0, we would expect those to, on average, have a teaching score of 3.88. In this case however, while the intercept has a mathematical interpretation when defining the regression line, there is no practical interpretation since score is an average of a panel of 6 students’ ratings from 1 to 10, a bty_avg of 0 would be impossible. Furthermore, no instructors had a beauty score anywhere near 0 in this data. Of more interest is the slope coefficient associated with bty_avg: \\[b_{\\text{bty avg}} = 0.067.\\] This is a numerical quantity that summarizes the relationship between the outcome and explanatory variables. It is interpreted as: For every increase of 1 unit in bty_avg, there is an associated increase of, on average, 0.067 units of score. We note in particular that the sign of this slope is positive, suggesting a positive relationship between beauty scores and teaching scores. We are very careful with our wording: We only stated that there is an associated increase, and not necessarily a causal increase. For example, perhaps it’s not that beauty directly affects teaching scores, but instead individuals from wealthier backgrounds tend to have had better education and training, and hence have higher teaching scores, but these same individuals also have higher beauty scores. Avoiding such reasoning can be summarized by the adage “correlation is not necessarily causation.” In other words, just because two variables are correlated, it doesn’t mean one directly causes the other. We discuss these ideas more in Subsection 6.3.2. We say that this associated increase is on average 0.067 units of teaching score and not that the associated increase is exactly 0.067 units of score across all values of bty_avg. This is because the slope is the average increase across all points as shown by the regression line in Figure 6.5. But what about the remaining 5 columns: std_error, statistic, p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci? They give you information on the statistical significance of these results, or their “meaningfulness” from a statistical perspective. We’ll revisit these in Chapter 11 on (statistical) inference for regression after we’ve covered standard errors in Chapter 8 (std_error), confidence intervals in Chapter 9 (lower_ci and upper_ci), and hypothesis testing in Chapter 10 (statistic and p_value). For now, we’ll only focus on the term and estimate columns. Learning check (LC6.2) Fit a new simple linear regression using lm(score ~ age, data = evals_small) where age is the new explanatory variable \\(x\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above? 6.1.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals We just saw how to get the value of the intercept and the slope of the regression line from the regression table generated by get_regression_table(). Now instead, say we want information on individual points. In this case, we focus on one of the \\(n = 463\\) instructors in this dataset, corresponding to a single row of evals_small. For example, say we are interested in the 21st instructor in this dataset: Table 6.3: Data for 21st instructor score bty_avg age 4.9 7.33 31 What is the value on the blue line corresponding to this instructor’s bty_avg of 7.333? In Figure 6.6 we mark three values in particular corresponding to this instructor. Note we revert back to the geom_point() as the geom_jitter() has random noise added to teach point, making it difficult to identify points exactly. Red circle: This is the observed value \\(y\\) = 4.9 and corresponds to this instructor’s actual teaching score. Red square: This is the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) and corresponds to the value on the regression line for \\(x\\) = 7.333. This value is computed using the intercept and slope in the regression table above: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x = 3.88 + 0.067 * 7.333 = 4.369\\] Blue arrow: The length of this arrow is the residual and is computed by subtracting the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) from the observed value \\(y\\). The residual can be thought of as the error or “lack of fit” of the regression line. In the case of this instructor, it is \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = 4.9 - 4.369 = 0.531. In other words, the model was off by 0.531 teaching score units for this instructor. Figure 6.6: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual What if we want both the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\times x\\) and the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) not only the 21st instructor but for all 463 instructors in the study? Recall that each instructor corresponds to one of the 463 rows in the evals_small data frame and also one of the 463 points in the regression plot in Figure 6.5. We could repeat the above calculations by hand 463 times, but that would be tedious and time consuming. Instead, let’s use the get_regression_points() function that we’ve included in the moderndive R package. Note that in the table below we only present the results for the 21st through the 24th instructors. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(score_model) regression_points Table 6.4: Regression points (for only 21st through 24th instructor) ID score bty_avg score_hat residual 21 4.9 7.33 4.37 0.531 22 4.6 7.33 4.37 0.231 23 4.5 7.33 4.37 0.131 24 4.4 5.50 4.25 0.153 Just as with the get_regression_table() function, the inputs to the get_regression_points() function are the same, however the outputs are different. Let’s inspect the individual columns: The score column represents the observed value of the outcome variable \\(y\\). The bty_avg column represents the values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). The score_hat column represents the fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\). The residual column represents the residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\). Just as we did for the 21st instructor in the evals_small dataset (in the first row of the table above), let’s repeat the above calculations for the 24th instructor in the evals_small dataset (in the fourth row of the table above): score = 4.4 is the observed value \\(y\\) for this instructor. bty_avg = 5.50 is the value of the explanatory variable \\(x\\) for this instructor. score_hat = 4.25 = 3.88 + 0.067 * \\(x\\) = 3.88 + 0.067 * 5.50 is the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) for this instructor. residual = 0.153 = 4.4 - 4.25 is the value of the residual for this instructor. In other words, the model was off by 0.153 teaching score units for this instructor. More development of this idea appears in Section 6.3.3 and we encourage you to read that section after you investigate residuals. 6.1.4 Residual analysis Recall the residuals can be thought of as the error or the “lack-of-fit” between the observed value \\(y\\) and the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) on the blue regression line in Figure 6.5. Ideally when we fit a regression model, we’d like there to be no systematic pattern to these residuals. We’ll be more specific as to what we mean by no systematic pattern when we see Figure 6.8 below, but let’s keep this notion imprecise for now. Investigating any such patterns is known as residual analysis and is the theme of this section. We’ll perform our residual analysis in two ways: Creating a scatterplot with the residuals on the \\(y\\)-axis and the original explanatory variable \\(x\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis. Creating a histogram of the residuals, thereby showing the distribution of the residuals. First, recall in Figure 6.6 above we created a scatterplot where on the vertical axis we had the teaching score \\(y\\), on the horizontal axis we had the beauty score \\(x\\), and the blue arrow represented the residual for one particular instructor. Instead, in Figure 6.7 below, let’s create a scatterplot where On the vertical axis we have the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) instead On the horizontal axis we have the beauty score \\(x\\) as before: ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = bty_avg, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Beauty Score&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 1) Figure 6.7: Plot of residuals over beauty score You can think of Figure 6.7 as Figure 6.6 but with the blue line flattened out to \\(y=0\\). Does it seem like there is no systematic pattern to the residuals? This question is rather qualitative and subjective in nature, thus different people may respond with different answers to the above question. However, it can be argued that there isn’t a drastic pattern in the residuals. Let’s now get a little more precise in our definition of no systematic pattern in the residuals. Ideally, the residuals should behave randomly. In addition, the residuals should be on average 0. In other words, sometimes the regression model will make a positive error in that \\(y - \\widehat{y} &gt; 0\\), sometimes the regression model will make a negative error in that \\(y - \\widehat{y} &lt; 0\\), but on average the error is 0. Further, the value and spread of the residuals should not depend on the value of \\(x\\). In Figure 6.8 below, we display some hypothetical examples where there are drastic patterns to the residuals. In Example 1, the value of the residual seems to depend on \\(x\\): the residuals tend to be positive for small and large values of \\(x\\) in this range, whereas values of \\(x\\) more in the middle tend to have negative residuals. In Example 2, while the residuals seem to be on average 0 for each value of \\(x\\), the spread of the residuals varies for different values of \\(x\\); this situation is known as heteroskedasticity. Figure 6.8: Examples of less than ideal residual patterns The second way to perform a residual analysis is to look at the histogram of the residuals: ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) Figure 6.9: Histogram of residuals This histogram seems to indicate that we have more positive residuals than negative. Since the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) is positive when \\(y &gt; \\widehat{y}\\), it seems our fitted teaching score from the regression model tends to underestimate the true teaching score. This histogram has a slight left-skew in that there is a long tail on the left. Another way to say this is this data exhibits a negative skew. Is this a problem? Again, there is a certain amount of subjectivity in the response. In the authors’ opinion, while there is a slight skew/pattern to the residuals, it isn’t a large concern. On the other hand, others might disagree with our assessment. Here are examples of an ideal and less than ideal pattern to the residuals when viewed in a histogram: Figure 6.10: Examples of ideal and less than ideal residual patterns In fact, we’ll see later on that we would like the residuals to be normally distributed with mean 0. In other words, be bell-shaped and centered at 0! While this requirement and residual analysis in general may seem to some of you as not being overly critical at this point, we’ll see later after when we cover inference for regression in Chapter 11 that for the last five columns of the regression table from earlier (std error, statistic, p_value,lower_ci, and upper_ci) to have valid interpretations, the above three conditions should roughly hold. Learning check (LC6.3) Continuing with our regression using age as the explanatory variable and teaching score as the outcome variable, use the get_regression_points() function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 463 instructors. Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Ideally, there should be little to no pattern. 6.2 One categorical explanatory variable It’s an unfortunate truth that life expectancy is not the same across various countries in the world; there are a multitude of factors that are associated with how long people live. International development agencies are very interested in studying these differences in the hope of understanding where governments should allocate resources to address this problem. In this section, we’ll explore differences in life expectancy in two ways: Differences between continents: Are there significant differences in life expectancy, on average, between the five continents of the world: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania? Differences within continents: How does life expectancy vary within the world’s five continents? For example, is the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Africa larger than the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Asia? To answer such questions, we’ll study the gapminder dataset in the gapminder package. Recall we mentioned this dataset in Subsection 3.1.2 when we first studied the “Grammar of Graphics” introduced in Figure 3.1. This dataset has international development statistics such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country (\\(n\\) = 142) for 5-year intervals between 1952 and 2007. We’ll use this data for linear regression again, but note that our explanatory variable \\(x\\) is now categorical, and not numerical like when we covered simple linear regression in Section 6.1. More precisely, we have: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\). In this case, life expectancy. A single categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\), In this case, the continent the country is part of. When the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is categorical, the concept of a “best-fitting” line is a little different than the one we saw previously in Section 6.1 where the explanatory variable \\(x\\) was numerical. We’ll study these differences shortly in Subsection 6.2.2, but first we conduct our exploratory data analysis. 6.2.1 Exploratory data analysis Let’s load the gapminder data and filter() for only observations in 2007. Next we select() only the variables we’ll need along with gdpPercap, which is each country’s gross domestic product per capita (GDP). GDP is a rough measure of that country’s economic performance. (This will be used for the upcoming Learning Check). Lastly, we save this in a data frame with name gapminder2007: library(gapminder) gapminder2007 &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% filter(year == 2007) %&gt;% select(country, continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap) Let’s you should look at the raw data values both by bringing up RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer and the glimpse() function. In Table 6.5 we only show 5 randomly selected countries out of 142: View(gapminder2007) Table 6.5: Random sample of 5 countries country continent lifeExp gdpPercap Slovak Republic Europe 74.7 18678 Israel Asia 80.7 25523 Bulgaria Europe 73.0 10681 Tanzania Africa 52.5 1107 Myanmar Asia 62.1 944 glimpse(gapminder2007) Observations: 142 Variables: 4 $ country &lt;fct&gt; Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Austral... $ continent &lt;fct&gt; Asia, Europe, Africa, Africa, Americas, Oceania, Europe, ... $ lifeExp &lt;dbl&gt; 43.8, 76.4, 72.3, 42.7, 75.3, 81.2, 79.8, 75.6, 64.1, 79.... $ gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt; 975, 5937, 6223, 4797, 12779, 34435, 36126, 29796, 1391, ... We see that the variable continent is indeed categorical, as it is encoded as fct which stands for “factor.” This is R’s way of storing categorical variables. Let’s look at a summary of the explanatory variable continent: summary(gapminder2007$continent) Africa Americas Asia Europe Oceania 52 25 33 30 2 We observe that all other continents have 25 countries or more, but Oceania only has two: Australia and New Zealand. Let’s now compute some summary statistics of the outcome variable lifeExp, in particular the worldwide median and mean life expectancy: lifeExp_worldwide &lt;- gapminder2007 %&gt;% summarize(median = median(lifeExp), mean = mean(lifeExp)) Table 6.6: Worldwide life expectancy median mean 71.9 67 Given that the global median life expectancy is 71.935, half of the world’s countries (71 countries) will have a life expectancy less than 71.935. Further, half will have a life expectancy greater than this value. The mean life expectancy of 67.007 is lower however. Why are these two values different? Let’s look at a histogram of lifeExp in Figure 6.11 to see why. Figure 6.11: Histogram of Life Expectancy in 2007 We see that this data is left-skewed/negatively skewed: there are a few countries with very low life expectancies that are bringing down the mean life expectancy. However, the median is less sensitive to the effects of such outliers. Hence the median is greater than the mean in this case. Let’s proceed by comparing median and mean life expectancy between continents by adding a group_by(continent) to the above code: lifeExp_by_continent &lt;- gapminder2007 %&gt;% group_by(continent) %&gt;% summarize(median = median(lifeExp), mean = mean(lifeExp)) Table 6.7: Life expectancy by continent continent median mean Africa 52.9 54.8 Americas 72.9 73.6 Asia 72.4 70.7 Europe 78.6 77.6 Oceania 80.7 80.7 We see now that there are differences in life expectancies between the continents. For example let’s focus on only medians. While the median life expectancy across all \\(n = 142\\) countries in 2007 was 71.935, the median life expectancy across the \\(n =52\\) countries in Africa was only 52.927. Let’s create a corresponding visualization. One way to compare the life expectancies of countries in different continents would be via a faceted histogram. Recall we saw back in the Data Visualization chapter, specifically Section 3.6, that facets allow us to split a visualization by the different levels of a categorical variable or factor variable. In Figure 6.12, the variable we facet by is continent, which is categorical with five levels, each corresponding to the five continents of the world. ggplot(gapminder2007, aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Number of countries&quot;, title = &quot;Life expectancy by continent&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) Figure 6.12: Life expectancy in 2007 Another way would be via a geom_boxplot where we map the categorical variable continent to the \\(x\\)-axis and the different life expectancies within each continent on the \\(y\\)-axis; we do this in Figure 6.13. ggplot(gapminder2007, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Continent&quot;, y = &quot;Life expectancy (years)&quot;, title = &quot;Life expectancy by continent&quot;) Figure 6.13: Life expectancy in 2007 Some people prefer comparing a numerical variable between different levels of a categorical variable, in this case comparing life expectancy between different continents, using a boxplot over a faceted histogram as we can make quick comparisons with single horizontal lines. For example, we can see that even the country with the highest life expectancy in Africa is still lower than all countries in Oceania. It’s important to remember however that the solid lines in the middle of the boxes correspond to the medians (i.e. the middle value) rather than the mean (the average). So, for example, if you look at Asia, the solid line denotes the median life expectancy of around 72 years, indicating to us that half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy below 72 years whereas half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy above 72 years. Furthermore, note that: Africa and Asia have much more spread/variation in life expectancy as indicated by the interquartile range (the height of the boxes). Oceania has almost no spread/variation, but this might in large part be due to the fact there are only two countries in Oceania: Australia and New Zealand. Now, let’s start making comparisons of life expectancy between continents. Let’s use Africa as a baseline for comparsion. Why Africa? Only because it happened to be first alphabetically, we could’ve just as appropriately used the Americas as the baseline for comparison. Using the “eyeball test” (just using our eyes to see if anything stands out), we make the following observations about differences in median life expectancy compared to the baseline of Africa: The median life expectancy of the Americas is roughly 20 years greater. The median life expectancy of Asia is roughly 20 years greater. The median life expectancy of Europe is roughly 25 years greater. The median life expectancy of Oceania is roughly 27.8 years greater. Let’s remember these four differences vs Africa corresponding to the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania: 20, 20, 25, 27.8. Learning check (LC6.4) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same explanatory variable \\(x\\) being continent but with gdpPercap as the new outcome variable \\(y\\). Remember, this involves three things: Looking at the raw values Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest. Creating informative visualizations What can you say about the differences in GDP per capita between continents based on this exploration? 6.2.2 Linear regression In Subsection 6.1.2 we introduced simple linear regression, which involves modeling the relationship between a numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of a numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\), in our life expectancy example, we now have a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) continent. While we still can fit a regression model, given our categorical explanatory variable we no longer have a concept of a “best-fitting” line, but differences relative to a baseline for comparison. Before we fit our regression model, let’s create a table similar to Table 6.7, but Report the mean life expectancy for each continent. Report the difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa’s mean life expectancy of 54.806 in the column “mean vs Africa”; this column is simply the “mean” column minus 54.806. Think back to your observations from the eyeball test of Figure 6.13 at the end of the last subsection. The column “mean vs Africa” is the same idea of comparing a summary statistic to a baseline for comparison, in this case the countries of Africa, but using means instead of medians. Table 6.8: Mean life expectancy by continent continent mean mean vs Africa Africa 54.8 0.0 Americas 73.6 18.8 Asia 70.7 15.9 Europe 77.6 22.8 Oceania 80.7 25.9 Now, let’s use the get_regression_table() function we introduced in Section 6.1.2 to get the regression table for gapminder2007 analysis: lifeExp_model &lt;- lm(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder2007) get_regression_table(lifeExp_model) Table 6.9: Linear regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 54.8 1.02 53.45 0 52.8 56.8 continentAmericas 18.8 1.80 10.45 0 15.2 22.4 continentAsia 15.9 1.65 9.68 0 12.7 19.2 continentEurope 22.8 1.70 13.47 0 19.5 26.2 continentOceania 25.9 5.33 4.86 0 15.4 36.5 Just as before, we have the term and estimates columns of interest, but unlike before, we now have 5 rows corresponding to 5 outputs in our table: an intercept like before, but also continentAmericas, continentAsia, continentEurope, and continentOceania. What are these values? intercept = 54.8 corresponds to the mean life expectancy for Africa. This mean life expectancy is treated as a baseline for comparison for the other continents. continentAmericas = 18.8 is the difference in mean life expectancies of the Americas minus Africa. Note that \\(18.80 = 73.6 - 54.8\\) is the 2nd “mean vs Africa” value in Table 6.8. continentAmericas = 15.9 is the difference in mean life expectancy of Asia minus Africa. Note that \\(15.9 = 70.7 - 54.8\\) is the 2nd “mean vs Africa” value in Table 6.8. continentEurope = 22.8 is the difference in mean life expectancy of Europe minus Africa. Note that \\(22.8 = 77.6 - 54.8\\) is the 3rd “mean vs Africa” value in Table 6.8. continentOceania = 25.9 is the difference in mean life expectancy of Oceania minus Africa. Note that \\(25.9 = 80.7 - 54.8\\) is the 3rd “mean vs Africa” value in Table 6.8. Let’s generalize this idea a bit. If we fit a linear regression model using a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) that has \\(k\\) levels, a regression model will return an intercept and \\(k - 1\\) “slope” coefficients. When \\(x\\) is a numerical explanatory variable the interpretation is of a “slope” coefficient, but when \\(x\\) is categorical the meaning is a little trickier. They are offsets relative to the baseline. In our case, since there are \\(k = 5\\) continents, the regression model returns an intercept corresponding to the baseline for comparison Africa and \\(k - 1 = 4\\) slope coefficients corresponding to the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Africa was chosen as the baseline by R for no other reason than it is first alphabetically of the 5 continents. You can manually specify which continent to use as baseline instead of the default choice of whichever comes first alphabetically, but we leave that to a more advanced course. (The forcats package is particularly nice for doing this and we encourage you to explore using it.) Learning check (LC6.5) Fit a new linear regression using lm(gdpPercap ~ continent, data = gapminder2007) where gdpPercap is the new outcome variable \\(y\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above? 6.2.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals Recall in Subsection 6.1.3 when we had a numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\), we defined: Observed values \\(y\\), or the observed value of the outcome variable Fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\), or the value on the regression line for a given \\(x\\) value Residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\), or the error between the observed value and the fitted value What do fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) and residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) correspond to when the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is categorical? Let’s investigate these values for the first 10 countries in the gapminder2007 dataset: Table 6.10: First 10 out of 142 countries country continent lifeExp gdpPercap Afghanistan Asia 43.8 975 Albania Europe 76.4 5937 Algeria Africa 72.3 6223 Angola Africa 42.7 4797 Argentina Americas 75.3 12779 Australia Oceania 81.2 34435 Austria Europe 79.8 36126 Bahrain Asia 75.6 29796 Bangladesh Asia 64.1 1391 Belgium Europe 79.4 33693 Recall the get_regression_points() function we used in Subsection 6.1.3 to return the observed value of the outcome variable, all explanatory variables, fitted values, and residuals for all points in the regression. Recall that each “point”. In this case, each row corresponds to one of 142 countries in the gapminder2007 dataset. They are also the 142 observations used to construct the boxplots in Figure 6.13. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(lifeExp_model) regression_points Table 6.11: Regression points (First 10 out of 142 countries) ID lifeExp continent lifeExp_hat residual 1 43.8 Asia 70.7 -26.900 2 76.4 Europe 77.6 -1.226 3 72.3 Africa 54.8 17.495 4 42.7 Africa 54.8 -12.075 5 75.3 Americas 73.6 1.712 6 81.2 Oceania 80.7 0.515 7 79.8 Europe 77.6 2.180 8 75.6 Asia 70.7 4.907 9 64.1 Asia 70.7 -6.666 10 79.4 Europe 77.6 1.792 Notice The fitted values lifeExp_hat \\(\\widehat{\\text{lifeexp}}\\). Countries in Africa have the same fitted value of 54.8, which is the mean life expectancy of Africa. Countries in Asia have the same fitted value of 70.7, which is the mean life expectancy of Asia. This similarly holds for countries in the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. The residual column is simply \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = lifeexp - lifeexp_hat. These values can be interpreted as that particular country’s deviation from the mean life expectancy of the respective continent’s mean. For example, the first row of this dataset corresponds to Afghanistan, and the residual of \\(-26.9 = 43.8 - 70.7\\) is Afghanistan’s mean life expectancy minus the mean life expectancy of all Asian countries. 6.2.4 Residual analysis Recall our discussion on residuals from Section 6.1.4 where our goal was to investigate whether or not there was a systematic pattern to the residuals. Ideally since residuals can be thought of as error, there should be no such pattern. While there are many ways to do such residual analysis, we focused on two approaches based on visualizations. A plot with residuals on the vertical axis and the predictor (in this case continent) on the horizontal axis A histogram of all residuals First, let’s plot the residuals versus continent in Figure 6.14, but also let’s plot all 142 points with a little horizontal random jitter by setting the width = 0.1 parameter in geom_jitter(): ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = continent, y = residual)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1) + labs(x = &quot;Continent&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;) Figure 6.14: Plot of residuals over continent We observe There seems to be a rough balance of both positive and negative residuals for all 5 continents. However, there is one clear outlier in Asia. It has the smallest residual, hence also has the smallest life expectancy in Asia. Let’s investigate the 5 countries in Asia with the shortest life expectancy: gapminder2007 %&gt;% filter(continent == &quot;Asia&quot;) %&gt;% arrange(lifeExp) Table 6.12: Countries in Asia with shortest life expectancy country continent lifeExp gdpPercap Afghanistan Asia 43.8 975 Iraq Asia 59.5 4471 Cambodia Asia 59.7 1714 Myanmar Asia 62.1 944 Yemen, Rep. Asia 62.7 2281 This was the earlier identified residual for Afghanistan of -26.9. Unfortunately given recent geopolitical turmoil, individuals who live in Afghanistan and, in particular in 2007, have a drastically lower life expectancy. Second, let’s look at a histogram of all 142 values of residuals in Figure 6.15. In this case, the residuals form a rather nice bell-shape, although there are a couple of very low and very high values at the tails. As we said previously, searching for patterns in residuals can be somewhat subjective, but ideally we hope there are no “drastic” patterns. ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) Figure 6.15: Histogram of residuals Learning check (LC6.6) Continuing with our regression using gdpPercap as the outcome variable and continent as the explanatory variable, use the get_regression_points() function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 142 countries in 2007 and perform a residual analysis to look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Is there a pattern? Please keep in mind that these types of questions are somewhat subjective and different people will most likely have different answers. The focus should be on being able to justify the conclusions made. 6.3 Related topics 6.3.1 Correlation coefficient Let’s re-plot Figure 6.1, but now consider a broader range of correlation coefficient values in Figure 6.16. Figure 6.16: Different Correlation Coefficients As we suggested in Subsection 6.1.1, interpreting coefficients that are not close to the extreme values of -1 and 1 can be subjective. To develop your sense of correlation coefficients, we suggest you play the following 80’s-style video game called “Guess the correlation”! Click on the image below to do so: 6.3.2 Correlation is not necessarily causation Causation is a tricky problem and frequently takes either carefully designed experiments or methods to control for the effects of potential confounding variables. Both these approaches attempt either to remove all confounding variables or take them into account as best they can, and only focus on the behavior of an outcome variable in the presence of the levels of the other variable(s). Be careful as you read studies to make sure that the writers aren’t falling into this fallacy of correlation implying causation. If you spot one, you may want to send them a link to Spurious Correlations. 6.3.3 Best fitting line Regression lines are also known as “best fitting lines”. But what do we mean by best? Let’s unpack the criteria that is used by regression to determine best. Recall the plot in Figure 6.6 where for a instructor with a beauty average score of \\(x=7.333\\) The observed value \\(y=4.9\\) was marked with a red circle The fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = 4.369\\) on the regression line was marked with a red square The residual \\(y-\\widehat{y} = 4.9-4.369 = 0.531\\) was the length of the blue arrow. Let’s do this for another arbitrarily chosen instructor whose beauty score was \\(x=2.333\\). The residual in this case is \\(2.7 - 4.036 = -1.336\\). Another arbitrarily chosen instructor whose beauty score was \\(x=3.667\\) results in the residual in this case being \\(4.4 - 4.125 = 0.2753\\). Let’s do this one more time for another arbitrarily chosen instructor. This instructor had a beauty score of \\(x = 6\\). The residual in this case is \\(3.8 - 4.28 = -0.4802\\). Now let’s say we repeated this process for all 463 instructors in our dataset. Regression minimizes the sum of all 463 arrow lengths squared. In other words, it minimizes the sum of the squared residuals: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i)^2 \\] We square the arrow lengths so that positive and negative deviations of the same amount are treated equally. That’s why alternative names for the simple linear regression line are the least-squares line and the best fitting line. It can be proven via calculus and linear algebra that this line uniquely minimizes the sum of the squared arrow lengths. For the regression line in the plot, the sum of the squared residuals is 131.879. This is the lowest possible value of the sum of the squared residuals of all possible lines we could draw on this scatterplot? How do we know this? We can mathematically prove this fact, but this requires some calculus and linear algebra, so let’s leave this proof for another course! 6.3.4 How does get_regression_table() work? Note that this subsection is optional! What is going on behind the scenes with the get_regression_table() from the moderndive package? Recall in Subsection 6.1.2 we noted that these are wrapper functions that take other pre-existing functions and “wraps” them in a single function. This wrapper function leverages the the tidy() function in the broom package and the clean_names() function in the janitor package to generate clean looking outputs. Here is what the regression table from Subsection 6.1.2 looks like: score_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_small) get_regression_table(score_model, digits = 3) term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 The main idea behind the get_regression_table() function is to hide you from the following code running behind the scenes, which we’ve found to be confusing to students in the past: library(broom) library(janitor) score_model %&gt;% tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 3) %&gt;% clean_names() %&gt;% rename(lower_ci = conf_low, upper_ci = conf_high) term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci (Intercept) 3.880 0.076 50.96 0 3.731 4.030 bty_avg 0.067 0.016 4.09 0 0.035 0.099 Note that the mutate_if() function is from the dplyr package and applies the round() function with 3 significant digits precision only to those variables that are numerical. But oof, the second code block is long and messy! We felt it appropriate to hide all this from you and give the function an easy-to-remember name: get_regression_table(). 6.4 Conclusion In this chapter, you’ve seen what we call “basic regression” when you only have one explanatory variable. In Chapter 7, we’ll study multiple regression where we have more than one explanatory variable! In particular, we’ll see why we’ve been conducting the residual analyses from Subsections {#model1residuals} and {#model2residuals}. We are actually verifying some very important assumptions that must be met for the std_error (standard error), p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci (the end-points of the confidence intervals) columns in our regression tables to have valid interpretation. Again, don’t worry for now if you don’t understand what these terms mean. After the next chapter on multiple regression, we’ll dive in! 6.4.1 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here. "],
["7-multiple-regression.html", "7 Multiple Regression 7.1 Two numerical explanatory variables 7.2 One numerical &amp; one categorical explanatory variable 7.3 Related topics 7.4 Conclusion", " 7 Multiple Regression In Chapter 6 we introduced ideas related to modeling, in particular that the fundamental premise of modeling is to make explicit the relationship between an outcome variable \\(y\\) and an explanatory/predictor variable \\(x\\). Recall further the synonyms that we used to also denote \\(y\\) as the dependent variable and \\(x\\) as an independent variable or covariate. There are many modeling approaches one could take, among the most well-known being linear regression, which was the focus of the last chapter. Whereas in the last chapter we focused solely on regression scenarios where there is only one explanatory/predictor variable, in this chapter, we now focus on modeling scenarios where there is more than one. This case of regression more than one explanatory variable is known as multiple regression. You can imagine when trying to model a particular outcome variable, like teaching evaluation score as in Section 6.1 or life expectancy as in Section 6.2, it would be very useful to incorporate more than one explanatory variable. Since our regression models will now consider more than one explanatory/predictor variable, the interpretation of the associated effect of any one explanatory/predictor variables must be made in conjunction with the others. For example, say we are modeling individuals’ incomes as a function of their number of years of education and their parents’ wealth. When interpreting the effect of education on income, one has to consider the effect of their parents’ wealth at the same time, as these two variables are almost certainly related. Make note of this throughout this chapter and as you work on interpreting the results of multiple regression models into the future. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(ISLR) 7.1 Two numerical explanatory variables Let’s now attempt to identify factors that are associated with how much credit card debt an individual will have. The textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani is an intermediate-level textbook on statistical and machine learning freely available here. It has an accompanying R package called ISLR with datasets that the authors use to demonstrate various machine learning methods. One dataset that is frequently used by the authors is the Credit dataset where predictions are made on the credit card balance held by \\(n = 400\\) credit card holders. These predictions are based on information about them like income, credit limit, and education level. Since no information was provided as to who these \\(n\\) = 400 individuals are and how they came to be included in this dataset, it will be hard to make any scientific claims based on this data. Recall our discussion from the previous chapter that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. That being said, we’ll still use Credit to demonstrate multiple regression with: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\), in this case credit card balance. Two explanatory variables: A first numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\). In this case, their credit limit. A second numerical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\). In this case, their income (in thousands of dollars). In the forthcoming Learning Checks, we’ll consider a different scenario: The same numerical outcome variable \\(y\\): credit card balance. Two new explanatory variables: A first numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\): their credit rating. A second numerical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\): their age. 7.1.1 Exploratory data analysis Let’s load the Credit data and select() only the needed subset of variables. However, what does the data(&quot;Credit&quot;) command do? It reloads a fresh copy of the Credit dataset just in case you’ve lost some of the original data. library(ISLR) data(&quot;Credit&quot;) Credit &lt;- Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Limit, Income, Rating, Age) Let’s look at the raw data values both by bringing up RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer and the glimpse() function. Although in Table 7.1 we only show 5 randomly selected credit card holders out of 400: View(Credit) Table 7.1: Random sample of 5 credit card holders Balance Limit Income Rating Age 141 1425 6045 39.8 459 32 9 279 3300 15.1 266 66 13 204 5308 80.6 394 57 262 1050 9310 180.4 665 67 267 15 4952 88.8 360 86 glimpse(Credit) Observations: 400 Variables: 5 $ Balance &lt;int&gt; 333, 903, 580, 964, 331, 1151, 203, 872, 279, 1350, 1407, 0... $ Limit &lt;int&gt; 3606, 6645, 7075, 9504, 4897, 8047, 3388, 7114, 3300, 6819,... $ Income &lt;dbl&gt; 14.9, 106.0, 104.6, 148.9, 55.9, 80.2, 21.0, 71.4, 15.1, 71... $ Rating &lt;int&gt; 283, 483, 514, 681, 357, 569, 259, 512, 266, 491, 589, 138,... $ Age &lt;int&gt; 34, 82, 71, 36, 68, 77, 37, 87, 66, 41, 30, 64, 57, 49, 75,... Let’s look at some summary statistics: Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Limit, Income) %&gt;% summary() Balance Limit Income Min. : 0 Min. : 855 Min. : 10.4 1st Qu.: 69 1st Qu.: 3088 1st Qu.: 21.0 Median : 460 Median : 4622 Median : 33.1 Mean : 520 Mean : 4736 Mean : 45.2 3rd Qu.: 863 3rd Qu.: 5873 3rd Qu.: 57.5 Max. :1999 Max. :13913 Max. :186.6 We observe, for example, The mean and median credit card balance is around $500. 25% of card holders had debts of 69 dollars or less. The mean and median credit card limit is just under $5000. 75% of these card holders had incomes of $57,500 or less. Since our outcome variable Balance and the explanatory variables Limit and Rating are numerical, we can compute the correlation coefficient between pairs of these variables. First, we could run the get_correlation() command as seen in Subsection 6.1.1 twice, once for each explanatory variable: Credit %&gt;% get_correlation(Balance ~ Limit) Credit %&gt;% get_correlation(Balance ~ Income) Or we can simultaneously compute them by returning a correlation matrix in Table 7.2. We can read off the correlation coefficient for any pair of variables by looking them up in the appropriate row/column combination. Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Limit, Income) %&gt;% cor() Table 7.2: Correlations between credit card balance, credit limit, and income Balance Limit Income Balance 1.000 0.862 0.464 Limit 0.862 1.000 0.792 Income 0.464 0.792 1.000 For example, the correlation coefficient of: Balance with itself is 1 as we would expect based on the definition of the correlation coefficient. Balance with Limit is 0.862. This indicates a strong positive linear relationship, which makes sense as only individuals with large credit limits can accrue large credit card balances. Balance with Income is 0.464. This is suggestive of another positive linear relationship, although not as strong as the relationship between Balance and Limit. As an added bonus, we can read off the correlation coefficient of the two explanatory variables, Limit and Income of 0.792. In this case, we say there is a high degree of collinearity between these two explanatory variables. Collinearity (or multicollinearity) is a phenomenon in which one explanatory variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. So in this case, if we knew someone’s credit card Limit and since Limit and Income are highly correlated, we could make a fairly accurate guess as to that person’s Income. Or put loosely, these two variables provided redundant information. For now let’s ignore any issues related to collinearity and press on. Let’s visualize the relationship of the outcome variable with each of the two explanatory variables in two separate plots: ggplot(Credit, aes(x = Limit, y = Balance)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Credit limit (in $)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card balance (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between balance and credit limit&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) ggplot(Credit, aes(x = Income, y = Balance)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Income (in $1000)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card balance (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between balance and income&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) Figure 7.1: Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income First, there is a positive relationship between credit limit and balance, since as credit limit increases so also does credit card balance; this is to be expected given the strongly positive correlation coefficient of 0.862. In the case of income, the positive relationship doesn’t appear as strong, given the weakly positive correlation coefficient of 0.464. However the two plots in Figure 7.1 only focus on the relationship of the outcome variable with each of the explanatory variables independently. To get a sense of the joint relationship of all three variables simultaneously through a visualization, let’s display the data in a 3-dimensional (3D) scatterplot, where The numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) Balance is on the z-axis (vertical axis) The two numerical explanatory variables form the “floor” axes. In this case The first numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\) Income is on of the floor axes. The second numerical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\) Limit is on the other floor axis. Click on the following image to open an interactive 3D scatterplot in your browser: Previously in Figure 6.5, we plotted a “best-fitting” regression line through a set of points where the numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) was teaching score and a single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) was bty_avg. What is the analogous concept when we have two numerical predictor variables? Instead of a best-fitting line, we now have a best-fitting plane, which is a 3D generalization of lines which exist in 2D. Click on the following image to open an interactive plot of the regression plane in your browser. Move the image around, zoom in, and think about how this plane generalizes the concept of a linear regression line to three dimensions. Learning check (LC7.1) Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same outcome variable \\(y\\) being Balance but with Rating and Age as the new explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Remember, this involves three things: Looking at the raw values Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest. Creating informative visualizations What can you say about the relationship between a credit card holder’s balance and their credit rating and age? Recall that if you’ve lost some information from the dataset in its original form by using select() with &lt;-, you can reload a fresh copy using data(&quot;Credit&quot;). 7.1.2 Multiple regression Just as we did when we had a single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) in Subsection 6.1.2 and when we had a single categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) in Subsection 6.2.2, we fit a regression model and obtained the regression table in our two numerical explanatory variable scenario. To fit a regression model and get a table using get_regression_table(), we now use a + to consider multiple explanatory variables. In this case since we want to perform a regression of Limit and Income simultaneously, we input Balance ~ Limit + Income. Balance_model &lt;- lm(Balance ~ Limit + Income, data = Credit) get_regression_table(Balance_model) Table 7.3: Multiple regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept -385.179 19.465 -19.8 0 -423.446 -346.912 Limit 0.264 0.006 45.0 0 0.253 0.276 Income -7.663 0.385 -19.9 0 -8.420 -6.906 How do we interpret these three values that define the regression plane? Intercept: -$385.18 (rounded to two decimal points to represent cents). The intercept in our case represents the credit card balance for an individual who has both a credit Limit of $0 and Income of $0. In our data however, the intercept has limited practical interpretation as no individuals had Limit or Income values of $0 and furthermore the smallest credit card balance was $0. Rather, it is used to situate the regression plane in 3D space. Limit: $0.26. Now that we have multiple variables to consider, we have to add a caveat to our interpretation: all other things being equal, for every increase of one unit in credit Limit (dollars), there is an associated increase of on average $0.26 in credit card balance. Note: Just as we did in Subsection 6.1.2, we are not making any causal statements, only statements relating to the association between credit limit and balance The all other things being equal is making a statement about all other explanatory variables, in this case only one: Income. This is equivalent to saying “holding Income constant, we observed an associated increase of $0.26 in credit card balance for every dollar increase in credit limit.” Income: -$7.66. Similarly, all other things being equal, for every increase of one unit in Income (in other words, $1000 in income), there is an associated decrease of on average $7.66 in credit card balance. However, recall in Figure 7.1 that when considered separately, both Limit and Income had positive relationships with the outcome variable Balance. As card holders’ credit limits increased their credit card balances tended to increase as well, and a similar relationship held for incomes and balances. In the above multiple regression, however, the slope for Income is now -7.66, suggesting a negative relationship between income and credit card balance. What explains these contradictory results? This is known as Simpson’s Paradox, a phenomenon in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. We expand on this in Subsection 7.3.2 where we’ll look at the relationship between credit Limit and credit card balance but split by different income bracket groups. Learning check (LC7.2) Fit a new simple linear regression using lm(Balance ~ Rating + Age, data = Credit) where Rating and Age are the new numerical explanatory variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Get information about the “best-fitting” line from the regression table by applying the get_regression_table() function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above? 7.1.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals As we did previously in Table 7.4, let’s unpack the output of the get_regression_points() function for our model for credit card balance for all 400 card holders in the dataset. Recall that each card holder corresponds to one of the 400 rows in the Credit data frame and also for one of the 400 3D points in the 3D scatterplots in Subsection 7.1.1. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(Balance_model) regression_points Table 7.4: Regression points (first 5 rows of 400) ID Balance Limit Income Balance_hat residual 1 333 3606 14.9 454 -120.8 2 903 6645 106.0 559 344.3 3 580 7075 104.6 683 -103.4 4 964 9504 148.9 986 -21.7 5 331 4897 55.9 481 -150.0 Recall the format of the output: Balance corresponds to \\(y\\) (the observed value) Balance_hat corresponds to \\(\\widehat{y}\\) (the fitted value) residual corresponds to \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) (the residual) 7.1.4 Residual analysis Recall in Section 6.1.4, our first residual analysis plot investigated the presence of any systematic pattern in the residuals when we had a single numerical predictor: bty_age. For the Credit card dataset, since we have two numerical predictors, Limit and Income, we must perform this twice: ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = Limit, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Credit limit (in $)&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;, title = &quot;Residuals vs credit limit&quot;) ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = Income, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Income (in $1000)&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;, title = &quot;Residuals vs income&quot;) Figure 7.2: Residuals vs credit limit and income In this case, there does appear to be a systematic pattern to the residuals. As the scatter of the residuals around the line \\(y=0\\) is definitely not consistent. This behavior of the residuals is further evidenced by the histogram of residuals in Figure 7.3. We observe that the residuals have a slight right-skew (recall we say that data is right-skewed, or positively-skewed, if there is a tail to the right). Ideally, these residuals should be bell-shaped around a residual value of 0. ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) Figure 7.3: Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income Another way to interpret this histogram is that since the residual is computed as \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = balance - balance_hat, we have some values where the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) is very much lower than the observed value \\(y\\). In other words, we are underestimating certain credit card holders’ balances by a very large amount. Learning check (LC7.3) Continuing with our regression using Rating and Age as the explanatory variables and credit card Balance as the outcome variable, use the get_regression_points() function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 400 credit card holders. Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. 7.2 One numerical &amp; one categorical explanatory variable Let’s revisit the instructor evaluation data introduced in Section 6.1, where we studied the relationship between instructor evaluation scores and their beauty scores. This analysis suggested that there is a positive relationship between bty_avg and score, in other words as instructors had higher beauty scores, they also tended to have higher teaching evaluation scores. Now let’s say instead of bty_avg we are interested in the numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\) age and furthermore we want to use a second explanatory variable \\(x_2\\), the (binary) categorical variable gender. Note: This study only focused on the gender binary of &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; when the data was collected and analyzed years ago. It has been tradition to use gender as an “easy” binary variable in the past in statistical analyses. We have chosen to include it here because of the interesting results of the study, but we also understand that a segment of the population is not included in this dichotomous assignment of gender and we advocate for more inclusion in future studies to show representation of groups that do not identify with the gender binary. We now resume our analyses using this evals data and hope that others find these results interesting and worth further exploration. Our modeling scenario now becomes A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\). As before, instructor evaluation score. Two explanatory variables: A numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\): in this case, their age. A categorical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\): in this case, their binary gender. 7.2.1 Exploratory data analysis Let’s reload the evals data and select() only the needed subset of variables. Note that these are different than the variables chosen in Chapter 6. Let’s given this the name evals_less. evals_less &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, age, gender) Let’s look at the raw data values both by bringing up RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer and the glimpse() function, although in Table 7.5 we only show 5 randomly selected instructors out of 463: View(evals_less) Table 7.5: Random sample of 5 instructors score age gender 3.6 34 male 4.9 43 male 3.3 47 male 4.4 33 female 4.7 60 male Let’s look at some summary statistics: summary(evals_less) score age gender Min. :2.30 Min. :29.0 female:195 1st Qu.:3.80 1st Qu.:42.0 male :268 Median :4.30 Median :48.0 Mean :4.17 Mean :48.4 3rd Qu.:4.60 3rd Qu.:57.0 Max. :5.00 Max. :73.0 In Figure 7.4, we plot a scatterplot of score over age. Given that gender is a binary categorical variable in this study, we can make some interesting tweaks: We can assign a color to points from each of the two levels of gender: female and male. Furthermore, the geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) layer automatically fits a different regression line for each since we have provided color = gender at the top level in ggplot(). This allows for all geom_etries that follow to have the same mapping of aes()thetics to variables throughout the plot. ggplot(evals_less, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) + geom_jitter() + labs(x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;, color = &quot;Gender&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) Figure 7.4: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin split by gender (jittered) We notice some interesting trends: There are almost no women faculty over the age of 60. We can see this by the lack of red dots above 60. Fitting separate regression lines for men and women, we see they have different slopes. We see that the associated effect of increasing age seems to be much harsher for women than men. In other words, as women age, the drop in their teaching score appears to be faster. 7.2.2 Multiple regression: Parallel slopes model Much like we started to consider multiple explanatory variables using the + sign in Subsection 7.1.2, let’s fit a regression model and get the regression table. This time we provide the name of score_model_2 to our regression model fit, in so as to not overwrite the model score_model from Section 6.1.2. score_model_2 &lt;- lm(score ~ age + gender, data = evals_less) get_regression_table(score_model_2) Table 7.6: Regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.484 0.125 35.79 0.000 4.238 4.730 age -0.009 0.003 -3.28 0.001 -0.014 -0.003 gendermale 0.191 0.052 3.63 0.000 0.087 0.294 The modeling equation for this scenario is: \\[ \\begin{align} \\widehat{y} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 * x_1 + b_2 * x_2 \\\\ \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}} * \\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}} * \\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}] \\\\ \\end{align} \\] where \\(\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}]\\) is an indicator function for sex == male. In other words, \\(\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}]\\) equals one if the current observation corresponds to a male professor, and 0 if the current observation corresponds to a female professor. This model can be visualized in Figure 7.5. Figure 7.5: Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin by gender: same slope We see that: Females are treated as the baseline for comparison for no other reason than “female” is alphabetically earlier than “male.” The \\(b_{male} = 0.1906\\) is the vertical “bump” that men get in their teaching evaluation scores. Or more precisely, it is the average difference in teaching score that men get relative to the baseline of women. Accordingly, the intercepts (which in this case make no sense since no instructor can have an age of 0) are : for women: \\(b_0\\) = 4.484 for men: \\(b_0 + b_{male}\\) = 4.484 + 0.191 = 4.675 Both men and women have the same slope. In other words, in this model the associated effect of age is the same for men and women. All other things being equal, for every increase of one year in age, there is on average an associated change of \\(b_{age}\\) = -0.009 (a decrease) in teaching score. But wait, why is Figure 7.5 different than Figure 7.4! What is going on? What we have in the original plot is known as an interaction effect between age and gender. Focusing on fitting a model for each of men and women, we see that the resulting regression lines are different. Thus, gender appears to interact in different ways for men and women with the different values of age. 7.2.3 Multiple regression: Interaction model We say a model has an interaction effect if the associated effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable. These types of models usually prove to be tricky to view on first glance because of their complexity. In this case, the effect of age will depend on the value of gender. Put differently, the effect of age on teaching scores will differ for men and for women, as was suggested by the different slopes for men and women in our visual exploratory data analysis in Figure 7.4. Let’s fit a regression with an interaction term. Instead of using the + sign in the enumeration of explanatory variables, we use the * sign. Let’s fit this regression and save it in score_model_3, then we get the regression table using the get_regression_table() function as before. score_model_interaction &lt;- lm(score ~ age * gender, data = evals_less) get_regression_table(score_model_interaction) Table 7.7: Regression table term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.883 0.205 23.80 0.000 4.480 5.286 age -0.018 0.004 -3.92 0.000 -0.026 -0.009 gendermale -0.446 0.265 -1.68 0.094 -0.968 0.076 age:gendermale 0.014 0.006 2.45 0.015 0.003 0.024 The modeling equation for this scenario is: \\[ \\begin{align} \\widehat{y} &amp;= b_0 + b_1*x_1 + b_2*x_2 + b_3*x_1*x_2\\\\ \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}}*\\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}}*\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}] + b_{\\mbox{age,male}}*\\mbox{age}*\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}] \\\\ \\end{align} \\] Oof, that’s a lot of rows in the regression table output and a lot of terms in the model equation. The fourth term being added on the right hand side of the equation corresponds to the interaction term. Let’s simplify things by considering men and women separately. First, recall that \\(\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}]\\) equals 1 if a particular observation (or row in evals_less) corresponds to a male instructor. In this case, using the values from the regression table the fitted value of \\(\\widehat{\\mbox{score}}\\) is: \\[ \\begin{align} \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}}*\\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}}*\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}] + b_{\\mbox{age,male}}*\\mbox{age}*\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}] \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}}*\\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}}*1 + b_{\\mbox{age,male}}*\\mbox{age}*1 \\\\ &amp;= \\left(b_0 + b_{\\mbox{male}}\\right) + \\left(b_{\\mbox{age}} + b_{\\mbox{age,male}} \\right)*\\mbox{age} \\\\ &amp;= \\left(4.883 + -0.446\\right) + \\left(-0.018 + 0.014 \\right)*\\mbox{age} \\\\ &amp;= 4.437 -0.004*\\mbox{age} \\end{align} \\] Second, recall that \\(\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}]\\) equals 0 if a particular observation corresponds to a female instructor. Again, using the values from the regression table the fitted value of \\(\\widehat{\\mbox{score}}\\) is: \\[ \\begin{align} \\widehat{\\mbox{score}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}}*\\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}}*\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}] + b_{\\mbox{age,male}}*\\mbox{age}*\\mathbb{1}[\\mbox{is male}] \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}}*\\mbox{age} + b_{\\mbox{male}}*0 + b_{\\mbox{age,male}}\\mbox{age}*0 \\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\mbox{age}}*\\mbox{age}\\\\ &amp;= 4.883 -0.018*\\mbox{age} \\end{align} \\] Let’s summarize these values in a table: Table 7.8: Comparison of male and female intercepts and age slopes Gender Intercept Slope for age Male instructors 4.44 -0.004 Female instructors 4.88 -0.018 We see that while male instructors have a lower intercept, as they age, they have a less steep associated average decrease in teaching scores: 0.004 teaching score units per year as opposed to -0.018 for women. This is consistent with the different slopes and intercepts of the red and blue regression lines fit in Figure 7.4. Recall our definition of a model having an interaction effect: when the associated effect of one variable, in this case age, depends on the value of another variable, in this case gender. But how do we know when it’s appropriate to include an interaction effect? For example, which is the more appropriate model? The regular multiple regression model without an interaction term we saw in Section 7.2.2 or the multiple regression model with the interaction term we just saw? We’ll revisit this question in Chapter 11 on “inference for regression.” 7.2.4 Observed/fitted values and residuals Now say we want to apply the above calculations for male and female instructors for all 463 instructors in the evals_less dataset. As our multiple regression models get more and more complex, computing such values by hand gets more and more tedious. The get_regression_points() function spares us this tedium and returns all fitted values and all residuals. For simplicity, let’s focus only on the fitted interaction model, which is saved in score_model_interaction. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(score_model_interaction) regression_points Table 7.9: Regression points (first 5 rows of 463) ID score age gender score_hat residual 1 4.7 36 female 4.25 0.448 2 4.1 36 female 4.25 -0.152 3 3.9 36 female 4.25 -0.352 4 4.8 36 female 4.25 0.548 5 4.6 59 male 4.20 0.399 Recall the format of the output: score corresponds to \\(y\\) the observed value score_hat corresponds to \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\mbox{score}}\\) the fitted value residual corresponds to the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) 7.2.5 Residual analysis As always, let’s perform a residual analysis first with a histogram: ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Residual&quot;) Figure 7.6: Interaction model histogram of residuals Second, the residuals as compared to the predictor variables: \\(x_1\\): numerical explanatory/predictor variable of age \\(x_2\\): categorical explanatory/predictor variable of gender ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = age, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;age&quot;, y = &quot;Residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 1) + facet_wrap(~ gender) Figure 7.7: Interaction model residuals vs predictor 7.3 Related topics 7.3.1 More on the correlation coefficient Recall from Table 7.2 that we saw the correlation coefficient between Income in thousands of dollars and credit card Balance was 0.464. What if in instead we looked at the correlation coefficient between Income and credit card Balance, but where Income was in dollars and not thousands of dollars? This can be done by multiplying Income by 1000. library(ISLR) data(Credit) Credit %&gt;% select(Balance, Income) %&gt;% mutate(Income = Income * 1000) %&gt;% cor() Table 7.10: Correlation between income (in $) and credit card balance Balance Income Balance 1.000 0.464 Income 0.464 1.000 We see it is the same! We say that the correlation coefficient is invariant to linear transformations! In other words, the correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be the same as the correlation between \\(a\\times x + b\\) and \\(y\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are numerical values (real numbers in mathematical terms). 7.3.2 Simpson’s Paradox Recall in Section 7.1, we saw the two following seemingly contradictory results when studying the relationship between credit card balance, credit limit, and income. On the one hand, the right hand plot of Figure 7.1 suggested that credit card balance and income were positively related: Figure 7.8: Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income On the other hand, the multiple regression in Table 7.3, suggested that when modeling credit card balance as a function of both credit limit and income at the same time, credit limit has a negative relationship with balance, as evidenced by the slope of -7.66. How can this be? First, let’s dive a little deeper into the explanatory variable Limit. Figure 7.9 shows a histogram of all 400 values of Limit, along with vertical red lines that cut up the data into quartiles, meaning: 25% of credit limits were between $0 and $3088. Let’s call this the “low” credit limit bracket. 25% of credit limits were between $3088 and $4622. Let’s call this the “medium-low” credit limit bracket. 25% of credit limits were between $4622 and $5873. Let’s call this the “medium-high” credit limit bracket. 25% of credit limits were over $5873. Let’s call this the “high” credit limit bracket. Figure 7.9: Histogram of credit limits and quartiles Let’s now display The scatterplot showing the relationship between credit card balance and limit (the right-hand plot of Figure 7.1). The scatterplot showing the relationship between credit card balance and limit now with a color aesthetic added corresponding to the credit limit bracket. Figure 7.10: Relationship between credit card balance and income for different credit limit brackets In the right-hand plot, the Red points (bottom-left) correspond to the low credit limit bracket. Green points correspond to the medium-low credit limit bracket. Blue points correspond to the medium-high credit limit bracket. Purple points (top-right) correspond to the high credit limit bracket. The left-hand plot focuses of the relationship between balance and income in aggregate, but the right-hand plot focuses on the relationship between balance and income broken down by credit limit bracket. Whereas in aggregate there is an overall positive relationship, when broken down we now see that for the low (red points), medium-low (green points), and medium-high (blue points) income bracket groups, the strong positive relationship between credit card balance and income disappears! Only for the high bracket does the relationship stay somewhat positive. In this example, credit limit is a confounding variable for credit card balance and income. 7.4 Conclusion 7.4.1 What’s to come? Congratulations! We’re ready to proceed to the third portion of this book: “statistical inference” using a new package called infer. Once we’ve covered Chapters 8 on sampling, 9 on confidence intervals, and 10 on hypothesis testing, we’ll come back to the models we’ve seen in “data modeling” in Chapter 11 on inference for regression. As we said at the end of Chapter 6, we’ll see why we’ve been conducting the residual analyses from Subsections 7.1.4 and 7.2.5. We are actually verifying some very important assumptions that must be met for the std_error (standard error), p_value, conf_low and conf_high (the end-points of the confidence intervals) columns in our regression tables to have valid interpretation.

The concepts behind sampling form the basis of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, which we’ll cover in Chapters ?? and ?? respectively. We will see that the tools that you learned in the data science segment of this book (data visualization, “tidy” data format, and data wrangling) will also play an important role here in the development of your understanding. As mentioned before, the concepts throughout this text all build into a culmination allowing you to “think with data.” Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(moderndive) # For loading CSV files: library(readr) 8.1 Sampling bowl Let’s start this chapter with a sampling exercise. Imagine you are given a large bowl with 2400 balls that are either red or white. We are interested in the proportion of balls in this bowl that are red, but you don’t have the time to do an exhaustive count. You are also given a “shovel” that you can insert into this bowl… Figure 8.1: A bowl with 2400 balls … and extract a sample of \\(n=50\\) balls: Figure 8.2: A shovel used to extract a sample of size n = 50 8.1.1 General sampling terminology Before we proceed, let’s define some terminology: Population: The population is a set of \\(N\\) observations we are interested in. In our example, it’s the bowl of \\(N=2400\\) balls. Population parameter: A population parameter is a numerical summary measure about the population. In our example, it’s the true population proportion \\(p\\) of the balls in the bowl that are red. Census: An exhaustive enumeration/counting of all observations in the population used to compute the population parameter exactly, much like the Decennial United States census attempts to exhaustively count the US population. In our example, this would correspond to exhaustively counting all red balls of the \\(N=2400\\) total balls and computing \\(p\\) exactly. When \\(N\\) is small, a census is feasible. However, when \\(N\\) is large, a census can get very expensive, either in terms of time, energy, or money. Sampling: Collecting a subset of size \\(n \\leq N\\) of observations from the population. Typically \\(n\\) is much smaller than \\(N\\). Note that small \\(n\\) corresponds to the smaller sample and big \\(N\\) corresponds to the larger population. In our example, this corresponds to using the shovel to extract a sample of \\(n=50\\) balls. Representative sampling: A sample is said be a representative sample if it “looks like the population”. In other words, the characteristics of the sample’s observations are a good representation of the characteristics of the population’s observations. In our example, this means does our sample of \\(n=50\\) balls “look like” the contents of the larger set of \\(N=2400\\) balls in the bowl. Point estimates/sample statistics: A summary statistic based on the sample of size \\(n\\) that estimates the population parameter. In our example, it’s the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the balls in the sample of \\(n=50\\) balls that are red. Key: The sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) is an estimate of the population proportion \\(p\\). Generalizability: We say a sample is generalizable if any results of based on the sample can generalize to the population. In our example, is \\(\\widehat{p}\\) a “good guess” of \\(p\\)? In other words, can we infer about the population based on our sample? Bias: In a statistical sense, we say bias occurs if certain observations of a population have a higher chance of being sampled than others. We say a sampling procedure is unbiased if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sample.d In our example, did each ball, irrespective of color, have an equal chance of being sampled? Random sampling: We say a sampling procedure is random if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion. The moral: If the sampling of a sample of size \\(n\\) is done at random, then The sample is unbiased and representative of the population, thus Any result based on the sample can generalize to the population, thus The point estimate/sample statistic is a “good guess” of the population parameter So in our example: If we properly mix the balls i.e. stir the bowl first before using the shovel to extract a sample of size \\(n=50\\), The contents of the shovel will “look like” the contents of the bowl, thus Any results based on the \\(n=50\\) balls in the shovel can generalize to the \\(N=2400\\) balls in the bowl, thus The sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the \\(n=50\\) balls in the shovel that are red is a “good guess” of the true population proportion \\(p\\) of the \\(N=2400\\) balls that are red. 8.2 Tactile sampling from bowl 8.2.1 Tactilely using shovel once Let’s now put our sampling shovel into action in the following tactile sampling exercise. “Tactile” just means physically tangible and perceptible by touch. Step 1 in Figure 8.3: Use the shovel to take a sample of size \\(n=50\\) balls from the bowl Step 2 in Figure 8.4: Pour them into a cup and Count the number that are red then Compute the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the \\(n=50\\) balls that are red. Step 3 in Figure 8.5: Mark the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) in a hand-drawn histogram. Figure 8.3: Step 1: Take sample of size \\(n=50\\) Figure 8.4: Step 2: Pour into Red Solo Cup and compute \\(\\widehat{p}\\) Figure 8.5: Step 3: Mark \\(\\widehat{p}\\)’s in histogram So, for example, in Figure 8.3 there are 18 balls out of \\(n=50\\) that are red. The sample proportion red for this particular sample is thus \\(\\widehat{p} = 18 / 50 = 0.36\\). Our intrepid students then marked this value in the hand-drawn histogram in Figure 8.5. After 10 groups of students completed this exercise, the resulting hand-drawn histogram is in Figure 8.6 below. Observe: Five of the sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\) (based on five different samples of size \\(n=50\\)) were in the histogram bin \\([0.30, 0.35)\\). In other words, sample proportions of \\(\\widehat{p} = 0.30\\) would be included in this bin, but sample proportions of \\(\\widehat{p} = 0.35\\) would be included in the next bin to the right. The lowest value of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) was somewhere between 0.20 and 0.25 The highest value of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) was somewhere between 0.45 and 0.50. Figure 8.6: Step 3: Histogram of 10 values of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 8.2.2 Tactilely using shovel 33 times All told, 33 groups tooks samples. In other words, the shovel was used 33 times and 33 values of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) were computed. Let’s import this data for all 33 groups and save it in a data frame called tactile_prop_red in Table 8.1. Notice how the replicate column enumerates each of the 33 groups, red_balls is the count of balls in the sample of size \\(n=50\\) that we red, and prop_red is the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) that are red. tactile_prop_red View(tactile_prop_red) Table 8.1: 33 sample proportions based on 33 tactile samples of size n = 50 group replicate red_balls prop_red Ilyas, Yohan 1 21 0.42 Morgan, Terrance 2 17 0.34 Martin, Thomas 3 21 0.42 Clark, Frank 4 21 0.42 Riddhi, Karina 5 18 0.36 Andrew, Tyler 6 19 0.38 Julia 7 19 0.38 Rachel, Lauren 8 11 0.22 Daniel, Caroline 9 15 0.30 Josh, Maeve 10 17 0.34 Emily, Emily 11 16 0.32 Conrad, Emily 12 18 0.36 Oliver, Erik 13 17 0.34 Isabel, Nam 14 21 0.42 X, Claire 15 15 0.30 Cindy, Kimberly 16 20 0.40 Kevin, James 17 11 0.22 Nam, Isabelle 18 21 0.42 Harry, Yuko 19 15 0.30 Yuki, Eileen 20 16 0.32 Ramses 21 23 0.46 Joshua, Elizabeth, Stanley 22 15 0.30 Siobhan, Jane 23 18 0.36 Jack, Will 24 16 0.32 Caroline, Katie 25 21 0.42 Griffin, Y 26 18 0.36 Kaitlin, Jordan 27 17 0.34 Ella, Garrett 28 18 0.36 Julie, Hailin 29 15 0.30 Katie, Caroline 30 21 0.42 Mallory, Damani, Melissa 31 21 0.42 Katie 32 16 0.32 Francis, Vignesh 33 19 0.38 8.2.3 Sampling distribution Using your data visualization skills that you honed in Chapter 3, let’s visualize the distribution of these 33 sample proportions red \\(\\widehat{p}\\) using a histogram with binwidth = 0.05. This visualization is appropriate since prop_red is a numerical variable. ggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample proportion red based on n = 50&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Histogram of 33 sample proportions based on 33 tactile samples of size n=50&quot;) Figure 8.7: Histogram of 33 sample proportions based on 33 tactile samples of size n=50 Let’s ask ourselves some questions: Where is the histogram centered? What is the spread of this histogram? Recall from Section 5.4 the mean and the standard deviation are two summary statistics that would answer this question: tactile_prop_red %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(prop_red), sd = sd(prop_red)) mean sd 0.356 0.058 What you have just unpacked are some very deep and very subtle concepts in statistical inference: The histogram in Figure 8.7 is called the sampling distribution of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) based on samples of size \\(n=50\\). It describes how values of the sample proportion red will vary from sample to sample due to sampling variability. It allows us to identify: Typical/common/plausible values of \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Ex: \\(\\widehat{p} = 0.36\\) would be such a value since it would in theory occur frequently. Atypical/rare/implausible values of \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Ex: \\(\\widehat{p} = 0.8\\) would be such a value since it lies far away from most of the distribution. If the sampling is done in an unbiased and random fashion, in other words we made sure to stir the bowl before we sampled, then the sampling distribution will be guaranteed to be centered at the true unknown population proportion red \\(p\\), or in other words the true number of balls out of 2400 that are red. The spread of this histogram, as quantified by the standard deviation of 0.058, is called the standard error. It quantifies the variability of our estimates for \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Note: A large source of confusion. All standard errors are a form of standard deviation, but not all standard deviations are standard errors. 8.3 Virtual sampling from bowl Now let’s mimic the above tactile sampling, but with virtual sampling. In other words: Instead of considering the tactile bowl shown in Figure 8.1 above and using a tactile shovel to draw samples of size \\(n=50\\) Let’s use a virtual bowl saved in a computer and use R’s random number generator as a virtual shovel to draw samples of size \\(n=50\\) First, we describe our virtual bowl. In the moderndive package, we’ve included a data frame called bowl that has 2400 rows corresponding to the \\(N=2400\\) balls in the physical bowl. Run View(bowl) in RStudio to convince yourselves that bowl is indeed a virtual version of the tactile bowl in the previous section. bowl Note that the balls are not actually marked with numbers; the variable ball_ID is merely used as an identification variable for each row of bowl. Recall our previous discussion on identification variables in Subsection 4.2.2 in the “Data Tidying” Chapter 4. Next, we describe our virtual shovel: the rep_sample_n() function included in the moderndive package where rep_sample_n() indicates that we are taking repeated/replicated samples of size \\(n\\). 8.3.1 Virtually using shovel once The rep_sample_n() function included in the moderndive package where rep_sample_n() indicates that we are taking repeated/replicated samples of size \\(n\\). Let’s perform the virtual analogue of tactilely inserting the shovel only once into the bowl and extracting a sample of size \\(n=50\\). In the table below we only show results about the first 10 sampled balls out of 50. virtual_shovel &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50) View(virtual_shovel) Table 8.2: First 10 sampled balls of 50 in virtual sample replicate ball_ID color 1 2079 red 1 1076 white 1 1691 red 1 1687 red 1 1434 white 1 954 white 1 483 white 1 1520 white 1 2060 red 1 1682 white Looking at all 50 rows of virtual_shovel in the spreadsheet viewer that pops up after running View(virtual_shovel) in RStudio, the ball_ID variable seems to suggest that we do indeed have a random sample of \\(n=50\\) balls. However, what does the replicate variable indidate, where in this case it’s equal to 1 for all 50 rows? We’ll see in a minute. First let’s compute both the number of balls red and the proportion red out of \\(n=50\\) using our dplyr data wrangling tools from Chapter 5: virtual_shovel %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) Table 8.3: Count and proportion red in single virtual sample of size n = 50 replicate red prop_red 1 23 0.46 Why does this work? Because for every row where color == &quot;red&quot;, the boolean TRUE is returned and R treats TRUE like the number 1. Equivalently, for every row where color is not equal to &quot;red&quot;, the boolean FALSE is returned and R treats FALSE like the number 0. So summing the number of TRUE’s and FALSE’s is equivalent to summing 1’s and 0’s which counts the number of balls where color is red. 8.3.2 Virtually using shovel 33 times Recall however in our tactile sampling exercise in Section 8.2 above that we had 33 groups of students take 33 samples total of size \\(n=50\\) using the shovel 33 times and hence compute 33 separate values of the sample proportion red \\(\\widehat{p}\\). In other words we repeated/replicated the sampling 33 times. We can achieve this by reusing the same rep_sample_n() function code above, but by adding the reps = 33 argument indicating we want to repeat this sampling 33 times: virtual_samples &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 33) View(virtual_samples) virtual_samples has \\(50 \\times 33 = 1650\\) rows, corresponding to 33 samples of size \\(n=50\\), or 33 draws from the shovel. We won’t display the contents of this data frame but leave it to you to View() this data frame. You’ll see that the first 50 rows have replicate equal to 1, then the next 50 rows have replicate equal to 2, and so on and so forth, up until the last 50 rows which have replicate equal to 33. The replicate variable denotes which of our 33 samples a particular ball is included in. Now let’s compute the 33 corresponding values of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) based on 33 different samples of size \\(n=50\\) by reusing the previous code, but remembering to group_by the replicate variable first since we want to compute the sample proportion for each of the 33 samples separately. Notice the similarity of this table with Table 8.1. virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) View(virtual_prop_red) Table 8.4: 33 sample proportions red based on 33 virtual samples of size n=50 replicate red prop_red 1 17 0.34 2 20 0.40 3 24 0.48 4 20 0.40 5 17 0.34 6 16 0.32 7 17 0.34 8 19 0.38 9 19 0.38 10 12 0.24 11 22 0.44 12 17 0.34 13 20 0.40 14 22 0.44 15 13 0.26 16 15 0.30 17 23 0.46 18 20 0.40 19 16 0.32 20 12 0.24 21 14 0.28 22 21 0.42 23 14 0.28 24 18 0.36 25 19 0.38 26 12 0.24 27 22 0.44 28 23 0.46 29 19 0.38 30 18 0.36 31 20 0.40 32 17 0.34 33 20 0.40 Just as we did before, let’s draw a histogram with binwidth = 0.05 of the 33 sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\): ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample proportion red based on n = 50&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Histogram of 33 sample proportions based on 33 virtual samples of size n=50&quot;) Figure 8.8: Histogram of 33 sample proportions red based on 33 virtual samples of size n=50 Let’s now compare the: Tactile sampling-based sampling distribution from the previous section to the Virtual sampling-based sampling distribution from this section We see that they are similar in terms of center and spread, although not identical due to random variation. 8.3.3 Virtually using shovel 1000 times In Figure 8.8, we can start seeing a pattern in the sampling distribution emerge. However, 33 values of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) might not be enough to get a true sense of the distribution. Using 1000 values of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) would definitely give a better sense. What are our two options for constructing these histograms? Tactile sampling: Make the 33 groups of students take \\(1000 / 33 \\approx 31\\) samples of size \\(n=50\\) each, count the number of red balls for each of the 1000 tactile samples, and then compute the 1000 corresponding values of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\). However, this would be cruel and unusual as this would take hours! Virtual sampling: Computers are very good at automating repetitive tasks such as this one. This is the way to go! First, generate 1000 samples of size \\(n=50\\) virtual_samples &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000) View(virtual_samples) Then for each of these 1000 samples of size \\(n=50\\), compute the corresponding sample proportions virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) View(virtual_prop_red) Finally plot it ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample proportion red based on n = 50&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Histogram of 1000 sample proportions from 1000 virtual samples of size n=50&quot;) Learning check (LC8.1) What is the standard error of the above sampling distribution of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) based on 1000 samples of size \\(n=50\\)? Recall you are virtually mimicking the act of sampling with the following tactile shovel with \\(n=50\\) slots: Figure 8.9: Tactile shovel for sampling n = 50 balls (LC8.2) Change the sample size to \\(n=25\\)? What difference do you notice about the sampling distribution and the standard error? This corresponds to virtually micking the act of sampling with the following tactile shovel with \\(n=25\\) slots: Figure 8.10: Tactile shovel for sampling n = 25 balls (LC8.3) Change the sample size to \\(n=100\\)? What difference do you notice about the sampling distribution and the standard error? This corresponds to virtually micking the act of sampling with the following tactile shovel with \\(n=100\\) slots, which would take forever to actually do tactilely!

For more details on infer visit https://infer-dev.netlify.com/. In Chapter 8, we explored the process of sampling from a representative sample to build a sampling distribution. The motivation there was to use multiple samples from the same population to visualize and attempt to understand the variability in the statistic from one sample to another. In most cases, we don’t have the population values as we did with the bowl of balls. We only have a single sample of data from a larger population. We’d like to be able to make some reasonable guesses about population parameters using that single sample to create a range of plausible values for a population parameter. This range of plausible values is known as a confidence interval and will be the focus of this chapter. And how do we use a single sample to get some idea of how other samples might vary in terms of their statistic values? One common way this is done is via a process known as bootstrapping that will be the focus of the beginning sections of this chapter. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(janitor) library(moderndive) # remotes::install_github(&quot;andrewpbray/infer&quot;, ref = &quot;develop&quot;) library(infer) # For loading CSV files: library(readr) 9.1 Bootstrapping 9.1.1 Data explanation The moderndive package contains a sample of 40 pennies collected and minted in the United States. Let’s explore this sample data first: pennies_sample The pennies_sample data frame has rows corresponding to a single penny with two variables: year of minting as shown on the penny and age_in_2011 giving the years the penny had been in circulation from 2011 as an integer, e.g. 15, 2, etc. Suppose we are interested in understanding some properties of the mean age of all US pennies from this data collected in 2011. How might we go about that? Let’s begin by understanding some of the properties of pennies_sample using data wrangling from Chapter 5 and data visualization from Chapter 3. 9.1.2 Exploratory data analysis First, let’s visualize the values in this sample as a histogram: ggplot(pennies_sample, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) We see a roughly symmetric distribution here that has quite a few values near 20 years in age with only a few larger than 40 years or smaller than 5 years. If pennies_sample is a representative sample from the population, we’d expect the age of all US pennies collected in 2011 to have a similar shape, a similar spread, and similar measures of central tendency like the mean. So where does the mean value fall for this sample? This point will be known as our point estimate and provides us with a single number that could serve as the guess to what the true population mean age might be. Recall how to find this using the dplyr package: x_bar &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) x_bar We’ve denoted this sample mean as \\(\\bar{x}\\), which is the standard symbol for denoting the mean of a sample. Our point estimate is, thus, \\(\\bar{x} = 25.1\\). Note that this is just one sample though providing just one guess at the population mean. What if we’d like to have another guess? This should all sound similar to what we did in Chapter 8. There instead of collecting just a single scoop of balls we had many different students use the shovel to scoop different samples of red and white balls. We then calculated a sample statistic (the sample proportion) from each sample. But, we don’t have a population to pull from here with the pennies. We only have this one sample. The process of bootstrapping allows us to use a single sample to generate many different samples that will act as our way of approximating a sampling distribution using a created bootstrap distribution instead. We will pull ourselves up from our bootstraps using a single sample (pennies_sample) to get an idea of the grander sampling distribution. 9.1.3 The Bootstrapping Process Bootstrapping uses a process of sampling with replacement from our original sample to create new bootstrap samples of the same size as our original sample. We can again make use of the rep_sample_n() function to explore what one such bootstrap sample would look like. Remember that we are randomly sampling from the original sample here with replacement and that we always use the same sample size for the bootstrap samples as the size of the original sample (pennies_sample). bootstrap_sample1 &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 40, replace = TRUE, reps = 1) bootstrap_sample1 Let’s visualize what this new bootstrap sample looks like: ggplot(bootstrap_sample1, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) We now have another sample from what we could assume comes from the population of interest. We can similarly calculate the sample mean of this bootstrap sample, called a bootstrap statistic. bootstrap_sample1 %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) We can see that this sample mean is smaller than the x_bar value we calculated earlier for the pennies_sample data. We’ll come back to analyzing the different bootstrap statistic values shortly. Let’s recap what was done to get to this bootstrap sample using a tactile explanation: First, pretend that each of the 40 values of age_in_2011 in pennies_sample were written on a small piece of paper. Recall that these values were 6, 30, 34, 19, 6, etc. Now, put the 40 small pieces of paper into a receptacle such as a baseball cap. Shake up the pieces of paper. Draw “at random” from the cap to select one piece of paper. Write down the value on this piece of paper. Say that it is 28. Now, place this piece of paper containing 28 back into the cap. Draw “at random” again from the cap to select a piece of paper. Note that this is the sampling with replacement part since you may draw 28 again. Repeat this process until you have drawn 40 pieces of paper and written down the values on these 40 pieces of paper. Completing this repetetion produces ONE bootstrap sample. If you look at the values in bootstrap_sample1, you can see how this process plays out. We originally drew 28, then we drew 11, then 7, and so on. Of course, we didn’t actually use pieces of paper and a cap here. We just had the computer perform this process for us to produce bootstrap_sample1 using rep_sample_n() with replace = TRUE set. The process of sampling with replacement is how we can use the original sample to take a guess as to what other values in the population may be. Sometimes in these bootstrap samples, we will select lots of larger values from the original sample, sometimes we will select lots of smaller values, and most frequently we will select values that are near the center of the sample. Let’s explore what the distribution of values of age_in_2011 for six different bootstrap samples looks like to further understand this variability. six_bootstrap_samples &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 40, replace = TRUE, reps = 6) ggplot(six_bootstrap_samples, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ replicate) We can also look at the six different means using dplyr syntax: six_bootstrap_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) Instead of doing this six times, we could do it 1000 times and then look at the distribution of stat across all 1000 of the replicates. This sets the stage for the infer R package (Bray et al. 2018) that was created to help users perform statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using verbs similar to what you’ve seen with dplyr. We’ll walk through setting up each of the infer verbs for confidence intervals using this pennies_sample example, while also explaining the purpose of the verbs in a general framework. 9.2 The infer package for statistical inference The infer package makes great use of the %&gt;% to create a pipeline for statistical inference. The goal of the package is to provide a way for its users to explain the computational process of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using the code as a guide. The verbs build in order here, so you’ll want to start with specify() and then continue through the others as needed. 9.2.1 Specify variables The specify() function is used primarily to choose which variables will be the focus of the statistical inference. In addition, a setting of which variable will act as the explanatory and which acts as the response variable is done here. For proportion problems to those in Chapter 8, we can also give which of the different levels we would like to have as a success. We’ll see further examples of these options in this chapter, Chapter 10, and in Appendix B. To begin to create a confidence interval for the population mean age of US pennies in 2011, we start by using specify() to choose which variable in our pennies_sample data we’d like to work with. This can be done in one of two ways: Using the response argument: pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) Using formula notation: pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = age_in_2011 ~ NULL) Note that the formula notation uses the common R methodology to include the response \\(y\\) variable on the left of the ~ and the explanatory \\(x\\) variable on the right of the “tilde.” Recall that you used this notation frequently with the lm() function in Chapters 6 and 7 when fitting regression models. Either notation works just fine, but a preference is usually given here for the formula notation to further build on the ideas from earlier chapters. 9.2.2 Generate replicates After specify()ing the variables we’d like in our inferential analysis, we next feed that into the generate() verb. The generate() verb’s main argument is reps, which is used to give how many different repetitions one would like to perform. Another argument here is type, which is automatically determined by the kinds of variables passed into specify(). We can also be explicit and set this type to be type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;. This type argument will be further used in hypothesis testing in Chapter 10 as well. Make sure to check out ?generate to see the options here and use the ? operator to better understand other verbs as well. Let’s generate() 1000 bootstrap samples: thousand_bootstrap_samples &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) We can use the dplyr count() function to help us understand what the thousand_bootstrap_samples data frame looks like: thousand_bootstrap_samples %&gt;% count(replicate) Notice that each replicate has 40 entries here. Now that we have 1000 different bootstrap samples, our next step is to calculate the bootstrap statistics for each sample. 9.2.3 Calculate summary statistics After generate()ing many different samples, we next want to condense those samples down into a single statistic for each replicated sample. As seen in the diagram, the calculate() function is helpful here. As we did at the beginning of this chapter, we now want to calculate the mean age_in_2011 for each bootstrap sample. To do so, we use the stat argument and set it to &quot;mean&quot; below. The stat argument has a variety of different options here and we will see further examples of this throughout the remaining chapters. bootstrap_distribution &lt;- pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) bootstrap_distribution We see that the resulting data has 1000 rows and 2 columns corresponding to the 1000 replicates and the mean for each bootstrap sample. Observed statistic / point estimate calculations Just as group_by() %&gt;% summarize() produces a useful workflow in dplyr, we can also use specify() %&gt;% calculate() to compute summary measures on our original sample data. It’s often helpful both in confidence interval calculations, but also in hypothesis testing to identify what the corresponding statistic is in the original data. For our example on penny age, we computed above a value of x_bar using the summarize() verb in dplyr: pennies_sample %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) This can also be done by skipping the generate() step in the pipeline feeding specify() directly into calculate(): pennies_sample %&gt;% specify(response = age_in_2011) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) This shortcut will be particularly useful when the calculation of the observed statistic is tricky to do using dplyr alone. This is particularly the case when working with more than one variable as will be seen in Chapter 10. 9.2.4 Visualize the results The visualize() verb provides a simple way to view the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the stat variable values. It has many other arguments that one can use as well including the shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize() The shape of this resulting distribution may look familiar to you. It resembles the well-known normal (bell-shaped) curve. The following diagram recaps the infer pipeline for creating a bootstrap distribution. 9.3 Now to confidence intervals Definition: Confidence Interval A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values for a parameter. It depends on a specified confidence level with higher confidence levels corresponding to wider confidence intervals and lower confidence levels corresponding to narrower confidence intervals. Common confidence levels include 90%, 95%, and 99%. Usually we don’t just begin sections with a definition, but confidence intervals are simple to define and play an important role in the sciences and any field that uses data. You can think of a confidence interval as playing the role of a net when fishing. Instead of just trying to catch a fish with a single spear (estimating an unknown parameter by using a single point estimate/statistic), we can use a net to try to provide a range of possible locations for the fish (use a range of possible values based around our statistic to make a plausible guess as to the location of the parameter). The bootstrapping process will provide bootstrap statistics that have a bootstrap distribution with center at (or extremely close to) the mean of the original sample. This can be seen by giving the observed statistic obs_stat argument the value of the point estimate x_bar. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = x_bar) We can also compute the mean of the bootstrap distribution of means to see how it compares to x_bar: bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% summarize(mean_of_means = mean(stat)) In this case, we can see that the bootstrap distribution provides us a guess as to what the variability in different sample means may look like only using the original sample as our guide. We can quantify this variability in the form of a 95% confidence interval in a couple different ways. 9.3.1 The percentile method One way to calculate a range of plausible values for the unknown mean age of coins in 2011 is to use the middle 95% of the bootstrap_distribution to determine our endpoints. Our endpoints are thus at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. This can be done with infer using the get_ci() function. (You can also use the conf_int() or get_confidence_interval() functions here as they are aliases that work the exact same way.) bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) These options are the default values for level and type so we can also just do: percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci() percentile_ci Using the percentile method, our range of plausible values for the mean age of US pennies in circulation in 2011 is 20.972 years to 29.252 years. We can use the visualize() function to view this using the endpoints and direction arguments, setting direction to &quot;between&quot; (between the values) and endpoints to be those stored with name percentile_ci. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = percentile_ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) You can see that 95% of the data stored in the stat variable in bootstrap_distribution falls between the two endpoints with 2.5% to the left outside of the shading and 2.5% to the right outside of the shading. The cut-off points that provide our range are shown with the darker lines. 9.3.2 The standard error method If the bootstrap distribution is close to symmetric and bell-shaped, we can also use a shortcut formula for determining the lower and upper endpoints of the confidence interval. This is done by using the formula \\(\\bar{x} \\pm (multiplier * SE),\\) where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is our original sample mean and \\(SE\\) stands for standard error and corresponds to the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution. The value of \\(multiplier\\) here is the appropriate percentile of the standard normal distribution. These are automatically calculated when level is provided with level = 0.95 being the default. (95% of the values in a standard normal distribution fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, so \\(multiplier = 1.96\\) for level = 0.95, for example.) As mentioned, this formula assumes that the bootstrap distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. This is often the case with bootstrap distributions, especially those in which the original distribution of the sample is not highly skewed. Definition: standard error The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The variability of the sampling distribution may be approximated by the variability of the bootstrap distribution. Traditional theory-based methodologies for inference also have formulas for standard errors, assuming some conditions are met. This \\(\\bar{x} \\pm (multiplier * SE)\\) formula is implemented in the get_ci() function as shown with our pennies problem using the bootstrap distribution’s variability as an approximation for the sampling distribution’s variability. We’ll see more on this approximation shortly. Note that the center of the confidence interval (the point_estimate) must be provided for the standard error confidence interval. standard_error_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci(type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = x_bar) standard_error_ci bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = standard_error_ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that both methods produce nearly identical confidence intervals with the percentile method being \\([20.97, 29.25]\\) and the standard error method being \\([20.97, 29.28]\\). 9.4 Comparing bootstrap and sampling distributions To help build up the idea of a confidence interval, we weren’t completely honest in our initial discussion. The pennies_sample data frame represents a sample from a larger number of pennies stored as pennies in the moderndive package. The pennies data frame (also in the moderndive package) contains 800 rows of data and two columns pertaining to the same variables as pennies_sample. Let’s begin by understanding some of the properties of the age_by_2011 variable in the pennies data frame. ggplot(pennies, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) pennies %&gt;% summarize(mean_age = mean(age_in_2011), median_age = median(age_in_2011)) We see that pennies is slightly right-skewed with the mean being pulled towards the upper outliers. Recall that pennies_sample was more symmetric than pennies. In fact, it actually exhibited some left-skew as we compare the mean and median values. ggplot(pennies_sample, aes(x = age_in_2011)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) pennies_sample %&gt;% summarize(mean_age = mean(age_in_2011), median_age = median(age_in_2011)) Sampling distribution Let’s assume that pennies represents our population of interest. We can then create a sampling distribution for the population mean age of pennies, denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\), using the rep_sample_n() function seen in Chapter 8. First we will create 1000 samples from the pennies data frame. thousand_samples &lt;- pennies %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 40, reps = 1000, replace = FALSE) When creating a sampling distribution, we do not replace the items when we create each sample. This is in contrast to the bootstrap distribution. It’s important to remember that the sampling distribution is sampling without replacement from the population to better understand sample-to-sample variability, whereas the bootstrap distribution is sampling with replacement from our original sample to better understand potential sample-to-sample variability. After sampling from pennies 1000 times, we next want to compute the mean age for each of the 1000 samples: sampling_distribution &lt;- thousand_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(stat = mean(age_in_2011)) We could use ggplot() with geom_histogram() again, but since we’ve named our column in summarize() to be stat, we can also use the shortcut visualize() function in infer and also specify the number of bins and also fill the bars with a different color such as &quot;salmon&quot;. This will be done to help remember that &quot;salmon&quot; corresponds to “sampling distribution”. sampling_distribution %&gt;% visualize(bins = 10, fill = &quot;salmon&quot;) Figure 9.1: Sampling distribution for n=40 samples of pennies We can also examine the variability in this sampling distribution by calculating the standard deviation of the stat column. Remember that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the standard error, frequently denoted as se. sampling_distribution %&gt;% summarize(se = sd(stat)) Bootstrap distribution Let’s now see how the shape of the bootstrap distribution compares to that of the sampling distribution. We’ll shade the bootstrap distribution blue to further assist with remembering which is which. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(bins = 10, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% summarize(se = sd(stat)) Notice that while the standard deviations are similar, the center of the sampling distribution and the bootstrap distribution differ: sampling_distribution %&gt;% summarize(mean_of_sampling_means = mean(stat)) bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% summarize(mean_of_bootstrap_means = mean(stat)) Since the bootstrap distribution is centered at the original sample mean, it doesn’t necessarily provide a good estimate of the overall population mean \\(\\mu\\). Let’s calculate the mean of age_in_2011 for the pennies data frame to see how it compares to the mean of the sampling distribution and the mean of the bootstrap distribution. pennies %&gt;% summarize(overall_mean = mean(age_in_2011)) Notice that this value matches up well with the mean of the sampling distribution. This is actually an artifact of the Central Limit Theorem introduced in Chapter 8. The mean of the sampling distribution is expected to be the mean of the overall population. The unfortunate fact though is that we don’t know the population mean in nearly all circumstances. The motivation of presenting it here was to show that the theory behind the Central Limit Theorem works using the tools you’ve worked with so far using the ggplot2, dplyr, moderndive, and infer packages. If we aren’t able to use the sample mean as a good guess for the population mean, how should we best go about estimating what the population mean may be if we can only select samples from the population. We’ve now come full circle and can discuss the underpinnings of the confidence interval and ways to interpret it. 9.5 Interpreting the confidence interval As shown above in Subsection 9.3.1, one range of plausible values for the population mean age of pennies in 2011, denoted by \\(\\mu\\), is \\([20.97, 29.25]\\). Recall that this confidence interval is based on bootstrapping using pennies_sample. Note that the mean of pennies (21.152) does fall in this confidence interval. If we had a different sample of size 40 and constructed a confidence interval using the same method, would we be guaranteed that it contained the population parameter value as well? Let’s try it out: pennies_sample2 &lt;- pennies %&gt;% sample_n(size = 40) Note the use of the sample_n() function in the dplyr package here. This does the same thing as rep_sample_n(reps = 1) but omits the extra replicate column. We next create an infer pipeline to generate a percentile-based 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\): percentile_ci2 &lt;- pennies_sample2 %&gt;% specify(formula = age_in_2011 ~ NULL) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) %&gt;% get_ci() percentile_ci2 This new confidence interval also contains the value of \\(\\mu\\). Let’s further investigate by repeating this process 100 times to get 100 different confidence intervals derived from 100 different samples of pennies. Each sample will have size of 40 just as the original sample. We will plot each of these confidence intervals as horizontal lines. We will also show a line corresponding to the known population value of 21.152 years. Of the 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \\(n = 40\\), 96 of them captured the population mean \\(\\mu = 21.152\\), whereas 4 of them did not include it. If we repeated this process of building confidence intervals more times with more samples, we’d expect 95% of them to contain the population mean. In other words, the procedure we have used to generate confidence intervals is “95% reliable” in that we can expect it to include the true population parameter 95% of the time if the process is repeated. To further accentuate this point, let’s perform a similar procedure using 90% confidence intervals instead. This time we will use the standard error method instead of the percentile method for computing the confidence intervals. Of the 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \\(n = 40\\), 87 of them captured the population mean \\(\\mu = 21.152\\), whereas 13 of them did not include it. Repeating this process for more samples would result in us getting closer and closer to 90% of the confidence intervals including the true value. It is common to say while interpretting a confidence interval to be “95% confident” or “90% confident” that the true value falls within the range of the specified confidence interval. We will use this “confident” language throughout the rest of this chapter, but remember that it has more to do with a measure of reliability of the building process. Back to our pennies example After this elaboration on what the level corresponds to in a confidence interval, let’s conclude by providing an interpretation of the original confidence interval result we found in Subsection 9.3.1. Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true mean age of pennies in circulation in 2011 is between 20.972 and 29.252 years. This level of confidence is based on the percentile-based method including the true mean 95% of the time if many different samples (not just the one we used) were collected and confidence intervals were created. 9.6 EXAMPLE: One proportion Let’s revisit our exercise of trying to estimate the proportion of red balls in the bowl from Chapter 8. We are now interested in determining a confidence interval for population parameter \\(p\\), the proportion of balls that are red out of the total \\(N = 2400\\) red and white balls. We will use the first sample reported from Ilyas and Yohan in Subsection 8.2.2 for our point estimate. They observed 21 red balls out of the 50 in their shovel. This data is stored in the tactile_shovel1 data frame in the moderndive package. tactile_shovel1 9.6.1 Observed Statistic To compute the proportion that are red in this data we can use the specify() %&gt;% calculate() workflow. Note the use of the success argument here to clarify which of the two colors &quot;red&quot; or &quot;white&quot; we are interested in. p_hat &lt;- tactile_shovel1 %&gt;% specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = &quot;red&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) p_hat 9.6.2 Bootstrap distribution Next we want to calculate many different bootstrap samples and their corresponding bootstrap statistic (the proportion of red balls). We’ve done 1000 in the past, but let’s go up to 10,000 now to better see the resulting distribution. Recall that this is done by including a generate() function call in the middle of our pipeline: tactile_shovel1 %&gt;% specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = &quot;red&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) This results in 50 rows for each of the 10,000 replicates. Lastly, we finish the infer pipeline by adding back in the calculate() step. bootstrap_props &lt;- tactile_shovel1 %&gt;% specify(formula = color ~ NULL, success = &quot;red&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) Let’s visualize() what the resulting bootstrap distribution looks like as a histogram. We’ve adjusted the number of bins here as well to better see the resulting shape. bootstrap_props %&gt;% visualize(bins = 25) We see that the resulting distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped so it doesn’t much matter which confidence interval method we choose. Let’s use the standard error method to create a 95% confidence interval. standard_error_ci &lt;- bootstrap_props %&gt;% get_ci(type = &quot;se&quot;, level = 0.95, point_estimate = p_hat) standard_error_ci bootstrap_props %&gt;% visualize(bins = 25, endpoints = standard_error_ci) We are 95% confident that the true proportion of red balls in the bowl is between 0.284 and years. This level of confidence is based on the standard error-based method including the true proportion 95% of the time if many different samples (not just the one we used) were collected and confidence intervals were created. 9.6.3 Theory-based confidence intervals When the bootstrap distribution has the nice symmetric, bell shape that we saw in the red balls example above, we can also use a formula to quantify the standard error. This provides another way to compute a confidence interval, but is a little more tedious and mathematical. The steps are outlined below. We’ve also shown how we can use the confidence interval (CI) interpretation in this case as well to support your understanding of this tricky concept. Procedure for building a theory-based CI for \\(p\\) To construct a theory-based confidence interval for \\(p\\), the unknown true population proportion we Collect a sample of size \\(n\\) Compute \\(\\widehat{p}\\) Compute the standard error \\[\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] Compute the margin of error \\[\\text{MoE} = 1.96 \\times \\text{SE} = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] Compute both end points of the confidence interval: The lower end point lower_ci: \\[\\widehat{p} - \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96\\times\\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96\\times\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] The upper end point upper_ci: \\[\\widehat{p} + \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} + 1.96\\times\\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} + 1.96\\times\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\] Alternatively, you can succinctly summarize a 95% confidence interval for \\(p\\) using the \\(\\pm\\) symbol: \\[ \\widehat{p} \\pm \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}} \\] Confidence intervals based on 33 tactile samples Let’s load the tactile sampling data for the 33 groups from Chapter 8. tactile_prop_red Let’s now apply the above procedure for constructing confidence intervals for \\(p\\) using the data saved in tactile_prop_red by adding/modifying new columns using the dplyr package data wrangling tools seen in Chapter 5: Rename prop_red to p_hat, the official name of the sample proportion Make explicit the sample size n of \\(n=50\\) the standard error SE the margin of error MoE the left endpoint of the confidence interval lower_ci the right endpoint of the confidence interval upper_ci conf_ints &lt;- tactile_prop_red %&gt;% rename(p_hat = prop_red) %&gt;% mutate( n = 50, SE = sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n), MoE = 1.96 * SE, lower_ci = p_hat - MoE, upper_ci = p_hat + MoE ) conf_ints Table 9.1: 33 confidence intervals from 33 tactile samples of size n=50 group red_balls p_hat n SE MoE lower_ci upper_ci Ilyas, Yohan 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Morgan, Terrance 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Martin, Thomas 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Clark, Frank 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Riddhi, Karina 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Andrew, Tyler 19 0.38 50 0.069 0.135 0.245 0.515 Julia 19 0.38 50 0.069 0.135 0.245 0.515 Rachel, Lauren 11 0.22 50 0.059 0.115 0.105 0.335 Daniel, Caroline 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Josh, Maeve 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Emily, Emily 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Conrad, Emily 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Oliver, Erik 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Isabel, Nam 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 X, Claire 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Cindy, Kimberly 20 0.40 50 0.069 0.136 0.264 0.536 Kevin, James 11 0.22 50 0.059 0.115 0.105 0.335 Nam, Isabelle 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Harry, Yuko 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Yuki, Eileen 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Ramses 23 0.46 50 0.070 0.138 0.322 0.598 Joshua, Elizabeth, Stanley 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Siobhan, Jane 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Jack, Will 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Caroline, Katie 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Griffin, Y 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Kaitlin, Jordan 17 0.34 50 0.067 0.131 0.209 0.471 Ella, Garrett 18 0.36 50 0.068 0.133 0.227 0.493 Julie, Hailin 15 0.30 50 0.065 0.127 0.173 0.427 Katie, Caroline 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Mallory, Damani, Melissa 21 0.42 50 0.070 0.137 0.283 0.557 Katie 16 0.32 50 0.066 0.129 0.191 0.449 Francis, Vignesh 19 0.38 50 0.069 0.135 0.245 0.515 Let’s plot: These 33 confidence intervals for \\(p\\): from lower_ci to upper_ci The true population proportion \\(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\\) with a red vertical line Figure 9.2: 33 confidence intervals based on 33 tactile samples of size n=50 We see that: In 31 cases, the confidence intervals “capture” the true \\(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\\) In 2 cases, the confidence intervals do not “capture” the true \\(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\\) Thus, the confidence intervals capture the true proportion $31 / 33 = 93.939% of the time using this theory-based methodology. Confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples Let’s say however, we repeated the above 100 times, not tactilely, but virtually. Let’s do this only 100 times instead of 1000 like we did before so that the results can fit on the screen. Again, the steps for compute a 95% confidence interval for \\(p\\) are: Collect a sample of size \\(n = 50\\) as we did in Chapter 8 Compute \\(\\widehat{p}\\): the sample proportion red of these \\(n=50\\) balls Compute the standard error \\(\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) Compute the margin of error \\(\\text{MoE} = 1.96 \\times \\text{SE} = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) Compute both end points of the confidence interval: lower_ci: \\(\\widehat{p} - \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96\\times\\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} - 1.96\\times\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) upper_ci: \\(\\widehat{p} + \\text{MoE} = \\widehat{p} + 1.96\\times\\text{SE} = \\widehat{p} +1.96\\times\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}\\) Run the following three steps, being sure to View() the resulting data frame after each step so you can convince yourself of what’s going on: # First: Take 100 virtual samples of n=50 balls virtual_samples &lt;- bowl %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 100) # Second: For each virtual sample compute the proportion red virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples %&gt;% group_by(replicate) %&gt;% summarize(red = sum(color == &quot;red&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(prop_red = red / 50) # Third: Compute the 95% confidence interval as above virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_prop_red %&gt;% rename(p_hat = prop_red) %&gt;% mutate( n = 50, SE = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n), MoE = 1.96 * SE, lower_ci = p_hat - MoE, upper_ci = p_hat + MoE ) Here are the results: Figure 9.3: 100 confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples of size n=50 We see that of our 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \\(n=50\\), 96 of them captured the true \\(p = 900/2400\\), whereas 4 of them missed. As we create more and more confidence intervals based on more and more samples, about 95% of these intervals will capture. In other words our procedure is “95% reliable.” Theoretical methods like this have largely been used in the past since we didn’t have the computing power to perform the simulation-based methods such as bootstrapping. They are still commonly used though and if the normality assumptions are met, they can provide a nice option for finding confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests as we will see in Chapter 10. 9.7 EXAMPLE: Comparing two proportions If you see someone else yawn, are you more likely to yawn? In an episode of the show Mythbusters, they tested the myth that yawning is contagious. The snippet from the show is available to view on the Discovery Network website here. Fifty adults who thought they were being considered for an appearance on the show were interviewed by a show recruiter (“confederate”) who either yawned or did not. Participants then sat by themselves in a large van and were asked to wait. While in the van, the Mythbusters watched via hidden camera to see if the unaware participants yawned. The data frame containing the results is available at mythbusters_yawn in the moderndive package. Let’s check it out. mythbusters_yawn The participant ID is stored in the subj variable with values of 1 to 50. The group variable is either &quot;seed&quot; for when a confederate was trying to influence the participant or &quot;control&quot; if a confederate did not interact with the participant. The yawn variable is either &quot;yes&quot; if the participant yawned or &quot;no&quot; if the participant did not yawn. We can use the janitor package to get a glimpse into this data in a table format: mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% tabyl(group, yawn) %&gt;% adorn_percentages() %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting() %&gt;% # To show original counts adorn_ns() We are interested in comparing the proportion of those that yawned after seeing a seed versus those that yawned with no seed interaction. We’d like to see if the difference between these two proportions is significantly larger than 0. If so, we’d have evidence to support the claim that yawning is contagious based on this study. In looking over this problem, we can make note of some important details to include in our infer pipeline: We are calling a success having a yawn value of &quot;yes&quot;. Our response variable will always correspond to the variable used in the success so the response variable is yawn. The explanatory variable is the other variable of interest here: group. To summarize, we are looking to see the examine the relationship between yawning and whether or not the participant saw a seed yawn or not. 9.7.1 Compute the point estimate mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group) Error in specify(., formula = yawn ~ group): A level of the response variable `yawn` needs to be specified for the `success` argument in `specify()`. Note that the success argument must be specified in situations such as this where the response variable has only two levels. mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) We next want to calculate the statistic of interest for our sample. This corresponds to the difference in the proportion of successes. mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;) Error: Statistic is based on a difference; specify the `order` in which to subtract the levels of the explanatory variable. `order = c(&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;)` means `(&quot;first&quot; - &quot;second&quot;)` Check `?calculate` for details. We see another error here. To further check to make sure that R knows exactly what we are after, we need to provide the order in which R should subtract these proportions of successes. As the error message states, we’ll want to put &quot;seed&quot; first after c() and then &quot;control&quot;: order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;). Our point estimate is thus calculated: obs_diff &lt;- mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) obs_diff This value represents the proportion of those that yawned after seeing a seed yawn (0.2941) minus the proportion of those that yawned with not seeing a seed (0.25). 9.7.2 Bootstrap distribution Our next step in building a confidence interval is to create a bootstrap distribution of statistics (differences in proportions of successes). We saw how it works with both a single variable in computing bootstrap means in Subsection 9.1.3 and in computing bootstrap proportions in Section 9.6, but we haven’t yet worked with bootstrapping involving multiple variables though. In the infer package, bootstrapping with multiple variables means that each row is potentially resampled. Let’s investigate this by looking at the first few rows of mythbusters_yawn: head(mythbusters_yawn) When we bootstrap this data, we are potentially pulling the subject’s readings multiple times. Thus, we could see the entries of &quot;seed&quot; for group and &quot;no&quot; for yawn together in a new row in a bootstrap sample. This is further seen by exploring the sample_n() function in dplyr on this smaller 6 row data frame comprised of head(mythbusters_yawn). The sample_n() function can perform this bootstrapping procedure and is similar to the rep_sample_n() function in infer, except that it is not repeated but rather only performs one sample with or without replacement. set.seed(2019) head(mythbusters_yawn) %&gt;% sample_n(size = 6, replace = TRUE) We can see that in this bootstrap sample generated from the first six rows of mythbusters_yawn, we have some rows repeated. The same is true when we perform the generate() step in infer as done below. bootstrap_distribution &lt;- mythbusters_yawn %&gt;% specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% visualize(bins = 20) This distribution is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped but isn’t quite there. Let’s use the percentile-based method to compute a 95% confidence interval for the true difference in the proportion of those that yawn with and without a seed presented. The arguments are explicitly listed here but remember they are the defaults and simply get_ci() can be used. bootstrap_distribution %&gt;% get_ci(type = &quot;percentile&quot;, level = 0.95) The confidence interval shown here includes the value of 0. We’ll see in Chapter 10 further what this means in terms of this difference being statistically significant or not, but let’s examine a bit here first. The range of plausible values for the difference in the proportion of that that yawned with and without a seed is between -0.219 and 0.293. Therefore, we are not sure which proportion is larger. Some of the bootstrap statistics showed the proportion without a seed to be higher and others showed the proportion with a seed to be higher. If the confidence interval was entirely above zero, we would be relatively sure (about “95% confident”) that the seed group had a higher proportion of yawning than the control group. Note that this all relates to the importance of denoting the order argument in the calculate() function. Since we specified &quot;seed&quot; and then &quot;control&quot; positive values for the statistic correspond to the &quot;seed&quot; proportion being higher, whereas negative values correspond to the &quot;control&quot; group being higher. We, therefore, have evidence via this confidence interval suggesting that the conclusion from the Mythbusters show that “yawning is contagious” being “confirmed” is not statistically appropriate.

This chapter introduced the notions of bootstrapping and confidence intervals as ways to build intuition about population parameters using only the original sample information. We also concluded with a glimpse into statistical significance and we’ll dig much further into this in Chapter 10 up next! 9.8.2 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here.

If you would like to contribute, please check us out on GitHub at https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book. Please check out our sneak peak of infer below in the meanwhile. For more details on infer visit https://infer-dev.netlify.com/. We saw some of the main concepts of hypothesis testing introduced in Chapters 8 and 9. We will expand further on these ideas here and also provide a framework for understanding hypothesis tests in general.Instead of presenting you with lots of different formulas and scenarios, we hope to build a way to think about all hypothesis tests. You can then adapt to different scenarios as needed down the road when you encounter different statistical situations. The same can be said for confidence intervals. There was one general framework that applies to all confidence intervals and we elaborated on this using the infer package pipeline in Chapter 9. The specifics may change slightly for each variation, but the important idea is to understand the general framework so that you can apply it to more specific problems. We believe that this approach is much better in the long-term than teaching you specific tests and confidence intervals rigorously. You can find fully-worked out examples for five common hypothesis tests and their corresponding confidence intervals in Appendix B. We recommend that you carefully review these examples as they also cover how the general frameworks apply to traditional normal-based methodologies like the \\(t\\)-test and normal-theory confidence intervals. You’ll see there that these methods are just approximations for the general computational frameworks, but require conditions to be met for their results to be valid. The general frameworks using randomization, simulation, and bootstrapping do not hold the same sorts of restrictions and further advance computational thinking, which is one big reason for their emphasis throughout this textbook. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) # remotes::install_github(&quot;andrewpbray/infer&quot;, ref = &quot;develop&quot;) library(infer) library(nycflights13) library(ggplot2movies) library(broom) 10.1 When inference is not needed Before we delve into hypothesis testing, it’s good to remember that there are cases where you need not perform a rigorous statistical inference. An important and time-saving skill is to ALWAYS do exploratory data analysis using dplyr and ggplot2 before thinking about running a hypothesis test. Let’s look at such an example selecting a sample of flights traveling to Boston and to San Francisco from New York City in the flights data frame in the nycflights13 package. (We will remove flights with missing data first using na.omit and then sample 100 flights going to each of the two airports.) bos_sfo &lt;- flights %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% filter(dest %in% c(&quot;BOS&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;)) %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% sample_n(100) Suppose we were interested in seeing if the air_time to SFO in San Francisco was statistically greater than the air_time to BOS in Boston. As suggested, let’s begin with some exploratory data analysis to get a sense for how the two variables of air_time and dest relate for these two destination airports: bos_sfo_summary &lt;- bos_sfo %&gt;% group_by(dest) %&gt;% summarize(mean_time = mean(air_time), sd_time = sd(air_time)) bos_sfo_summary Looking at these results, we can clearly see that SFO air_time is much larger than BOS air_time. The standard deviation is also extremely informative here. Learning check (LC10.1) Could we make the same type of immediate conclusion that SFO had a statistically greater air_time if, say, its corresponding standard deviation was 200 minutes? What about 100 minutes? Explain. To further understand just how different the air_time variable is for BOS and SFO, let’s look at a boxplot: ggplot(data = bos_sfo, mapping = aes(x = dest, y = air_time)) + geom_boxplot() Since there is no overlap at all, we can conclude that the air_time for San Francisco flights is statistically greater (at any level of significance) than the air_time for Boston flights. This is a clear example of not needing to do anything more than some simple exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics and data visualization to get an appropriate inferential conclusion. This is one reason why you should ALWAYS investigate the sample data first using dplyr and ggplot2 via exploratory data analysis. As you get more and more practice with hypothesis testing, you’ll be better able to determine in many cases whether or not the results will be statistically significant. There are circumstances where it is difficult to tell, but you should always try to make a guess FIRST about significance after you have completed your data exploration and before you actually begin the inferential techniques. 10.2 Basics of hypothesis testing In a hypothesis test, we will use data from a sample to help us decide between two competing hypotheses about a population. We make these hypotheses more concrete by specifying them in terms of at least one population parameter of interest. We refer to the competing claims about the population as the null hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_0\\), and the alternative (or research) hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_a\\). The roles of these two hypotheses are NOT interchangeable. The claim for which we seek significant evidence is assigned to the alternative hypothesis. The alternative is usually what the experimenter or researcher wants to establish or find evidence for. Usually, the null hypothesis is a claim that there really is “no effect” or “no difference.” In many cases, the null hypothesis represents the status quo or that nothing interesting is happening. We assess the strength of evidence by assuming the null hypothesis is true and determining how unlikely it would be to see sample results/statistics as extreme (or more extreme) as those in the original sample. Hypothesis testing brings about many weird and incorrect notions in the scientific community and society at large. One reason for this is that statistics has traditionally been thought of as this magic box of algorithms and procedures to get to results and this has been readily apparent if you do a Google search of “flowchart statistics hypothesis tests”. There are so many different complex ways to determine which test is appropriate. You’ll see that we don’t need to rely on these complicated series of assumptions and procedures to conduct a hypothesis test any longer. These methods were introduced in a time when computers weren’t powerful. Your cellphone (in 2016) has more power than the computers that sent NASA astronauts to the moon after all. We’ll see that ALL hypothesis tests can be broken down into the following framework given by Allen Downey here: Figure 10.1: Hypothesis Testing Framework Before we hop into this framework, we will provide another way to think about hypothesis testing that may be useful. 10.3 Criminal trial analogy We can think of hypothesis testing in the same context as a criminal trial in the United States. A criminal trial in the United States is a familiar situation in which a choice between two contradictory claims must be made. The accuser of the crime must be judged either guilty or not guilty. Under the U.S. system of justice, the individual on trial is initially presumed not guilty. Only STRONG EVIDENCE to the contrary causes the not guilty claim to be rejected in favor of a guilty verdict. The phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” is often used to set the cutoff value for when enough evidence has been given to convict. Theoretically, we should never say “The person is innocent.” but instead “There is not sufficient evidence to show that the person is guilty.” Now let’s compare that to how we look at a hypothesis test. The decision about the population parameter(s) must be judged to follow one of two hypotheses. We initially assume that \\(H_0\\) is true. The null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) will be rejected (in favor of \\(H_a\\)) only if the sample evidence strongly suggests that \\(H_0\\) is false. If the sample does not provide such evidence, \\(H_0\\) will not be rejected. The analogy to “beyond a reasonable doubt” in hypothesis testing is what is known as the significance level. This will be set before conducting the hypothesis test and is denoted as \\(\\alpha\\). Common values for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.1, 0.01, and 0.05. 10.3.1 Two possible conclusions Therefore, we have two possible conclusions with hypothesis testing: Reject \\(H_0\\) Fail to reject \\(H_0\\) Gut instinct says that “Fail to reject \\(H_0\\)” should say “Accept \\(H_0\\)” but this technically is not correct. Accepting \\(H_0\\) is the same as saying that a person is innocent. We cannot show that a person is innocent; we can only say that there was not enough substantial evidence to find the person guilty. When you run a hypothesis test, you are the jury of the trial. You decide whether there is enough evidence to convince yourself that \\(H_a\\) is true (“the person is guilty”) or that there was not enough evidence to convince yourself \\(H_a\\) is true (“the person is not guilty”). You must convince yourself (using statistical arguments) which hypothesis is the correct one given the sample information. Important note: Therefore, DO NOT WRITE “Accept \\(H_0\\)” any time you conduct a hypothesis test. Instead write “Fail to reject \\(H_0\\).” 10.4 Types of errors in hypothesis testing Unfortunately, just as a jury or a judge can make an incorrect decision in regards to a criminal trial by reaching the wrong verdict, there is some chance we will reach the wrong conclusion via a hypothesis test about a population parameter. As with criminal trials, this comes from the fact that we don’t have complete information, but rather a sample from which to try to infer about a population. The possible erroneous conclusions in a criminal trial are an innocent person is convicted (found guilty) or a guilty person is set free (found not guilty). The possible errors in a hypothesis test are rejecting \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is true (Type I Error) or failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is false (Type II Error). The risk of error is the price researchers pay for basing an inference about a population on a sample. With any reasonable sample-based procedure, there is some chance that a Type I error will be made and some chance that a Type II error will occur. To help understand the concepts of Type I error and Type II error, observe the following table: Figure 10.2: Type I and Type II errors If we are using sample data to make inferences about a parameter, we run the risk of making a mistake. Obviously, we want to minimize our chance of error; we want a small probability of drawing an incorrect conclusion. The probability of a Type I Error occurring is denoted by \\(\\alpha\\) and is called the significance level of a hypothesis test The probability of a Type II Error is denoted by \\(\\beta\\). Formally, we can define \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) in regards to the table above, but for hypothesis tests instead of a criminal trial. \\(\\alpha\\) corresponds to the probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\) when, in fact, \\(H_0\\) is true. \\(\\beta\\) corresponds to the probability of failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when, in fact, \\(H_0\\) is false. Ideally, we want \\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0\\), meaning that the chance of making an error does not exist. When we have to use incomplete information (sample data), it is not possible to have both \\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0\\). We will always have the possibility of at least one error existing when we use sample data. Usually, what is done is that \\(\\alpha\\) is set before the hypothesis test is conducted and then the evidence is judged against that significance level. Common values for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10. If \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), we are using a testing procedure that, used over and over with different samples, rejects a TRUE null hypothesis five percent of the time. So if we can set \\(\\alpha\\) to be whatever we want, why choose 0.05 instead of 0.01 or even better 0.0000000000000001? Well, a small \\(\\alpha\\) means the test procedure requires the evidence against \\(H_0\\) to be very strong before we can reject \\(H_0\\). This means we will almost never reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\alpha\\) is very small. If we almost never reject \\(H_0\\), the probability of a Type II Error – failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when we should – will increase! Thus, as \\(\\alpha\\) decreases, \\(\\beta\\) increases and as \\(\\alpha\\) increases, \\(\\beta\\) decreases. We, therefore, need to strike a balance in \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) and the common values for \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10 usually lead to a nice balance. Learning check (LC10.2) Reproduce the table above about errors, but for a hypothesis test, instead of the one provided for a criminal trial. 10.4.1 Logic of hypothesis testing Take a random sample (or samples) from a population (or multiple populations) If the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis, do not reject the null hypothesis. If the sample data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis), reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence the alternative hypothesis is true (based on the particular sample collected). 10.5 Statistical significance The idea that sample results are more extreme than we would reasonably expect to see by random chance if the null hypothesis were true is the fundamental idea behind statistical hypothesis tests. If data at least as extreme would be very unlikely if the null hypothesis were true, we say the data are statistically significant. Statistically significant data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, and allow us to generalize our sample results to the claim about the population. Learning check (LC10.3) What is wrong about saying “The defendant is innocent.” based on the US system of criminal trials? (LC10.4) What is the purpose of hypothesis testing? (LC10.5) What are some flaws with hypothesis testing? How could we alleviate them? 10.6 Hypothesis testing with infer The “There is Only One Test” diagram mentioned in Section 10.2 was the inspiration for the infer pipeline that you saw for confidence intervals in Chapter 9. For hypothesis tests, we include one more verb into the pipeline: the hypothesize() verb. Its main argument is null which is either &quot;point&quot; for point hypotheses involving a single sample or &quot;independence&quot; for testing for independence between two variables. We’ll first explore the two variable case by comparing two means. Note the section headings here that refer to the “There is Only One Test” diagram. We will lay out the specifics for each problem using this framework and the infer pipeline together. 10.7 Example: Comparing two means 10.7.1 Randomization/permutation We will now focus on building hypotheses looking at the difference between two population means in an example. We will denote population means using the Greek symbol \\(\\mu\\) (pronounced “mu”). Thus, we will be looking to see if one group “out-performs” another group. This is quite possibly the most common type of statistical inference and serves as a basis for many other types of analyses when comparing the relationship between two variables. Our null hypothesis will be of the form \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\), which can also be written as \\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\). Our alternative hypothesis will be of the form \\(H_0: \\mu_1 \\star \\mu_2\\) (or \\(H_a: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\, \\star \\, 0\\)) where \\(\\star\\) = \\(&lt;\\), \\(\\ne\\), or \\(&gt;\\) depending on the context of the problem. You needn’t focus on these new symbols too much at this point. It will just be a shortcut way for us to describe our hypotheses. As we saw in Chapter 9, bootstrapping is a valuable tool when conducting inferences based on one or two population variables. We will see that the process of randomization (also known as permutation) will be valuable in conducting tests comparing quantitative values from two groups. 10.7.2 Comparing action and romance movies The movies dataset in the ggplot2movies package contains information on a large number of movies that have been rated by users of IMDB.com (Wickham 2015). We are interested in the question here of whether Action movies are rated higher on IMDB than Romance movies. We will first need to do a little bit of data wrangling using the ideas from Chapter 5 to get the data in the form that we would like: movies_trimmed &lt;- movies %&gt;% select(title, year, rating, Action, Romance) Note that Action and Romance are binary variables here. To remove any overlap of movies (and potential confusion) that are both Action and Romance, we will remove them from our population: movies_trimmed &lt;- movies_trimmed %&gt;% filter(!(Action == 1 &amp; Romance == 1)) We will now create a new variable called genre that specifies whether a movie in our movies_trimmed data frame is an &quot;Action&quot; movie, a &quot;Romance&quot; movie, or &quot;Neither&quot;. We aren’t really interested in the &quot;Neither&quot; category here so we will exclude those rows as well. Lastly, the Action and Romance columns are not needed anymore since they are encoded in the genre column. movies_trimmed &lt;- movies_trimmed %&gt;% mutate(genre = case_when(Action == 1 ~ &quot;Action&quot;, Romance == 1 ~ &quot;Romance&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Neither&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(genre != &quot;Neither&quot;) %&gt;% select(-Action, -Romance) The case_when function is useful for assigning values in a new variable based on the values of another variable. The last step of TRUE ~ &quot;Neither&quot; is used when a particular movie is not set to either Action or Romance. We are left with 8878 movies in our population dataset that focuses on only &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Romance&quot; movies. Learning check (LC10.6) Why are the different genre variables stored as binary variables (1s and 0s) instead of just listing the genre as a column of values like “Action”, “Comedy”, etc.? (LC10.7) What complications could come above with us excluding action romance movies? Should we question the results of our hypothesis test? Explain. Let’s now visualize the distributions of rating across both levels of genre. Think about what type(s) of plot is/are appropriate here before you proceed: ggplot(data = movies_trimmed, aes(x = genre, y = rating)) + geom_boxplot() Figure 10.3: Rating vs genre in the population We can see that the middle 50% of ratings for &quot;Action&quot; movies is more spread out than that of &quot;Romance&quot; movies in the population. &quot;Romance&quot; has outliers at both the top and bottoms of the scale though. We are initially interested in comparing the mean rating across these two groups so a faceted histogram may also be useful: ggplot(data = movies_trimmed, mapping = aes(x = rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_grid(genre ~ .) Figure 10.4: Faceted histogram of genre vs rating Important note: Remember that we hardly ever have access to the population values as we do here. This example and the nycflights13 dataset were used to create a common flow from chapter to chapter. In nearly all circumstances, we’ll be needing to use only a sample of the population to try to infer conclusions about the unknown population parameter values. These examples do show a nice relationship between statistics (where data is usually small and more focused on experimental settings) and data science (where data is frequently large and collected without experimental conditions). 10.7.3 Sampling \\(\\rightarrow\\) randomization We can use hypothesis testing to investigate ways to determine, for example, whether a treatment has an effect over a control and other ways to statistically analyze if one group performs better than, worse than, or different than another. We are interested here in seeing how we can use a random sample of action movies and a random sample of romance movies from movies to determine if a statistical difference exists in the mean ratings of each group. Learning check (LC10.8) Define the relevant parameters here in terms of the populations of movies. 10.7.4 Data Let’s select a random sample of 34 action movies and a random sample of 34 romance movies. (The number 34 was chosen somewhat arbitrarily here.) set.seed(2017) movies_genre_sample &lt;- movies_trimmed %&gt;% group_by(genre) %&gt;% sample_n(34) %&gt;% ungroup() Note the addition of the ungroup() function here. This will be useful shortly in allowing us to permute the values of rating across genre. Our analysis does not work without this ungroup() function since the data stays grouped by the levels of genre without it. We can now observe the distributions of our two sample ratings for both groups. Remember that these plots should be rough approximations of our population distributions of movie ratings for &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Romance&quot; in our population of all movies in the movies data frame. ggplot(data = movies_genre_sample, aes(x = genre, y = rating)) + geom_boxplot() Figure 10.5: Genre vs rating for our sample ggplot(data = movies_genre_sample, mapping = aes(x = rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_grid(genre ~ .) Figure 10.6: Genre vs rating for our sample as faceted histogram Learning check (LC10.9) What single value could we change to improve the approximation using the sample distribution on the population distribution? Do we have reason to believe, based on the sample distributions of rating over the two groups of genre, that there is a significant difference between the mean rating for action movies compared to romance movies? It’s hard to say just based on the plots. The boxplot does show that the median sample rating is higher for romance movies, but the histogram isn’t as clear. The two groups have somewhat differently shaped distributions but they are both over similar values of rating. It’s often useful to calculate the mean and standard deviation as well, conditioned on the two levels. summary_ratings &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% group_by(genre) %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(rating), std_dev = sd(rating), n = n()) summary_ratings Learning check (LC10.10) Why did we not specify na.rm = TRUE here as we did in Chapter 5? We see that the sample mean rating for romance movies, \\(\\bar{x}_{r}\\), is greater than the similar measure for action movies, \\(\\bar{x}_a\\). But is it statistically significantly greater (thus, leading us to conclude that the means are statistically different)? The standard deviation can provide some insight here but with these standard deviations being so similar it’s still hard to say for sure. Learning check (LC10.11) Why might the standard deviation provide some insight about the means being statistically different or not? 10.7.5 Model of \\(H_0\\) The hypotheses we specified can also be written in another form to better give us an idea of what we will be simulating to create our null distribution. \\(H_0: \\mu_r - \\mu_a = 0\\) \\(H_a: \\mu_r - \\mu_a \\ne 0\\) 10.7.6 Test statistic \\(\\delta\\) We are, therefore, interested in seeing whether the difference in the sample means, \\(\\bar{x}_r - \\bar{x}_a\\), is statistically different than 0. We can now come back to our infer pipeline for computing our observed statistic. Note the order argument that shows the mean value for &quot;Action&quot; being subtracted from the mean value of &quot;Romance&quot;. 10.7.7 Observed effect \\(\\delta^*\\) obs_diff &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) obs_diff Our goal next is to figure out a random process with which to simulate the null hypothesis being true. Recall that \\(H_0: \\mu_r - \\mu_a = 0\\) corresponds to us assuming that the population means are the same. We would like to assume this is true and perform a random process to generate() data in the model of the null hypothesis. 10.7.8 Simulated data Tactile simulation Here, with us assuming the two population means are equal (\\(H_0: \\mu_r - \\mu_a = 0\\)), we can look at this from a tactile point of view by using index cards. There are \\(n_r = 34\\) data elements corresponding to romance movies and \\(n_a = 34\\) for action movies. We can write the 34 ratings from our sample for romance movies on one set of 34 index cards and the 34 ratings for action movies on another set of 34 index cards. (Note that the sample sizes need not be the same.) The next step is to put the two stacks of index cards together, creating a new set of 68 cards. If we assume that the two population means are equal, we are saying that there is no association between ratings and genre (romance vs action). We can use the index cards to create two new stacks for romance and action movies. First, we must shuffle all the cards thoroughly. After doing so, in this case with equal values of sample sizes, we split the deck in half. We then calculate the new sample mean rating of the romance deck, and also the new sample mean rating of the action deck. This creates one simulation of the samples that were collected originally. We next want to calculate a statistic from these two samples. Instead of actually doing the calculation using index cards, we can use R as we have before to simulate this process. Let’s do this just once and compare the results to what we see in movies_genre_sample. shuffled_ratings_old &lt;- #movies_trimmed %&gt;% movies_genre_sample %&gt;% mutate(genre = mosaic::shuffle(genre)) %&gt;% group_by(genre) %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(rating)) diff(shuffled_ratings_old$mean) [1] 0.126 permuted_ratings &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1) Learning check (LC10.12) How would the tactile shuffling of index cards change if we had different samples of say 20 action movies and 60 romance movies? Describe each step that would change. (LC10.13) Why are we taking the difference in the means of the cards in the new shuffled decks? 10.7.9 Distribution of \\(\\delta\\) under \\(H_0\\) The generate() step completes a permutation sending values of ratings to potentially different values of genre from which they originally came. It simulates a shuffling of the ratings between the two levels of genre just as we could have done with index cards. We can now proceed in a similar way to what we have done previously with bootstrapping by repeating this process many times to create simulated samples, assuming the null hypothesis is true. generated_samples &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) A null distribution of simulated differences in sample means is created with the specification of stat = &quot;diff in means&quot; for the calculate() step. The null distribution is similar to the bootstrap distribution we saw in Chapter 9, but remember that it consists of statistics generated assuming the null hypothesis is true. We can now plot the distribution of these simulated differences in means: null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% visualize() Figure 10.7: Simulated differences in means histogram 10.7.10 The p-value Remember that we are interested in seeing where our observed sample mean difference of 0.95 falls on this null/randomization distribution. We are interested in simply a difference here so “more extreme” corresponds to values in both tails on the distribution. Let’s shade our null distribution to show a visual representation of our \\(p\\)-value: null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Figure 10.8: Shaded histogram to show p-value Remember that the observed difference in means was 0.95. We have shaded red all values at or above that value and also shaded red those values at or below its negative value (since this is a two-tailed test). By giving obs_stat = obs_diff a vertical darker line is also shown at 0.95. To better estimate how large the \\(p\\)-value will be, we also increase the number of bins to 100 here from 20: null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% visualize(bins = 100, obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Figure 10.9: Histogram with vertical lines corresponding to observed statistic At this point, it is important to take a guess as to what the \\(p\\)-value may be. We can see that there are only a few permuted differences as extreme or more extreme than our observed effect (in both directions). Maybe we guess that this \\(p\\)-value is somewhere around 2%, or maybe 3%, but certainly not 30% or more. Lastly, we calculate the \\(p\\)-value directly using infer: pvalue &lt;- null_distribution_two_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue We have around 0.46% of values as extreme or more extreme than our observed statistic in both directions. Assuming we are using a 5% significance level for \\(\\alpha\\), we have evidence supporting the conclusion that the mean rating for romance movies is different from that of action movies. The next important idea is to better understand just how much higher of a mean rating can we expect the romance movies to have compared to that of action movies. 10.7.11 Corresponding confidence interval One of the great things about the infer pipeline is that going between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals is incredibly simple. To create a null distribution, we ran null_distribution_two_means &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) To get the corresponding bootstrap distribution with which we can compute a confidence interval, we can just remove or comment out the hypothesize() step since we are no longer assuming the null hypothesis is true when we bootstrap: percentile_ci_two_means &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% # hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) %&gt;% get_ci() percentile_ci_two_means Thus, we can expect the true mean of Romance movies on IMDB to have a rating 0.333 to 1.593 points higher than that of Action movies. Remember that this is based on bootstrapping using movies_genre_sample as our original sample and the confidence interval process being 95% reliable. Learning check (LC10.14) Conduct the same analysis comparing action movies versus romantic movies using the median rating instead of the mean rating? What was different and what was the same? (LC10.15) What conclusions can you make from viewing the faceted histogram looking at rating versus genre that you couldn’t see when looking at the boxplot? (LC10.16) Describe in a paragraph how we used Allen Downey’s diagram to conclude if a statistical difference existed between mean movie ratings for action and romance movies. (LC10.17) Why are we relatively confident that the distributions of the sample ratings will be good approximations of the population distributions of ratings for the two genres? (LC10.18) Using the definition of “\\(p\\)-value”, write in words what the \\(p\\)-value represents for the hypothesis test above comparing the mean rating of romance to action movies. (LC10.19) What is the value of the \\(p\\)-value for the hypothesis test comparing the mean rating of romance to action movies? (LC10.20) Do the results of the hypothesis test match up with the original plots we made looking at the population of movies? Why or why not? 10.7.12 Summary To review, these are the steps one would take whenever you’d like to do a hypothesis test comparing values from the distributions of two groups: Simulate many samples using a random process that matches the way the original data were collected and that assumes the null hypothesis is true. Collect the values of a sample statistic for each sample created using this random process to build a null distribution. Assess the significance of the original sample by determining where its sample statistic lies in the null distribution. If the proportion of values as extreme or more extreme than the observed statistic in the randomization distribution is smaller than the pre-determined significance level \\(\\alpha\\), we reject \\(H_0\\). Otherwise, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). (If no significance level is given, one can assume \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).) 10.8 Building theory-based methods using computation As a point of reference, we will now discuss the traditional theory-based way to conduct the hypothesis test for determining if there is a statistically significant difference in the sample mean rating of Action movies versus Romance movies. This method and ones like it work very well when the assumptions are met in order to run the test. They are based on probability models and distributions such as the normal and \\(t\\)-distributions. These traditional methods have been used for many decades back to the time when researchers didn’t have access to computers that could run 5000 simulations in a few seconds. They had to base their methods on probability theory instead. Many fields and researchers continue to use these methods and that is the biggest reason for their inclusion here. It’s important to remember that a \\(t\\)-test or a \\(z\\)-test is really just an approximation of what you have seen in this chapter already using simulation and randomization. The focus here is on understanding how the shape of the \\(t\\)-curve comes about without digging big into the mathematical underpinnings. 10.8.1 Example: \\(t\\)-test for two independent samples What is commonly done in statistics is the process of normalization. What this entails is calculating the mean and standard deviation of a variable. Then you subtract the mean from each value of your variable and divide by the standard deviation. The most common normalization is known as the \\(z\\)-score. The formula for a \\(z\\)-score is \\[Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma},\\] where \\(x\\) represent the value of a variable, \\(\\mu\\) represents the mean of the variable, and \\(\\sigma\\) represents the standard deviation of the variable. Thus, if your variable has 10 elements, each one has a corresponding \\(z\\)-score that gives how many standard deviations away that value is from its mean. \\(z\\)-scores are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. They have the common, bell-shaped pattern seen below. Recall, that we hardly ever know the mean and standard deviation of the population of interest. This is almost always the case when considering the means of two independent groups. To help account for us not knowing the population parameter values, we can use the sample statistics instead, but this comes with a bit of a price in terms of complexity. Another form of normalization occurs when we need to use the sample standard deviations as estimates for the unknown population standard deviations. This normalization is often called the \\(t\\)-score. For the two independent samples case like what we have for comparing action movies to romance movies, the formula is \\[T =\\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_1}^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{{s_2}^2}{n_2}} }\\] There is a lot to try to unpack here. \\(\\bar{x}_1\\) is the sample mean response of the first group \\(\\bar{x}_2\\) is the sample mean response of the second group \\(\\mu_1\\) is the population mean response of the first group \\(\\mu_2\\) is the population mean response of the second group \\(s_1\\) is the sample standard deviation of the response of the first group \\(s_2\\) is the sample standard deviation of the response of the second group \\(n_1\\) is the sample size of the first group \\(n_2\\) is the sample size of the second group Assuming that the null hypothesis is true (\\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\)), \\(T\\) is said to be distributed following a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the smaller value of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\). The “degrees of freedom” can be thought of measuring how different the \\(t\\) distribution will be as compared to a normal distribution. Small sample sizes lead to small degrees of freedom and, thus, \\(t\\) distributions that have more values in the tails of their distributions. Large sample sizes lead to large degrees of freedom and, thus, \\(t\\) distributions that closely align with the standard normal, bell-shaped curve. So, assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, our formula simplifies a bit: \\[T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_1}^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{{s_2}^2}{n_2}} }.\\] We have already built an approximation for what we think the distribution of \\(\\delta = \\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\) looks like using randomization above. Recall this distribution: ggplot(data = null_distribution_two_means, aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) Figure 10.10: Simulated differences in means histogram The infer package also includes some built-in theory-based statistics as well, so instead of going through the process of trying to transform the difference into a standardized form, we can just provide a different value for stat in calculate(). Recall the generated_samples data frame created via: generated_samples &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 5000) We can now created a null distribution of \\(t\\) statistics: null_distribution_t &lt;- generated_samples %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) null_distribution_t %&gt;% visualize() We see that the shape of this stat = &quot;t&quot; distribution is the same as that of stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;. The scale has changed though with the \\(t\\) values having less spread than the difference in means. A traditional \\(t\\)-test doesn’t look at this simulated distribution, but instead it looks at the \\(t\\)-curve with degrees of freedom equal to 62.029. We can overlay this distribution over the top of our permuted \\(t\\) statistics using the method = &quot;both&quot; setting in visualize(). null_distribution_t %&gt;% visualize(method = &quot;both&quot;) We can see that the curve does a good job of approximating the randomization distribution here. (More on when to expect for this to be the case when we discuss conditions for the \\(t\\)-test in a bit.) To calculate the \\(p\\)-value in this case, we need to figure out how much of the total area under the \\(t\\)-curve is at our observed \\(T\\)-statistic or more, plus also adding the area under the curve at the negative value of the observed \\(T\\)-statistic or below. (Remember this is a two-tailed test so we are looking for a difference–values in the tails of either direction.) Just as we converted all of the simulated values to \\(T\\)-statistics, we must also do so for our observed effect \\(\\delta^*\\): obs_t &lt;- movies_genre_sample %&gt;% specify(formula = rating ~ genre) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;)) So graphically we are interested in finding the percentage of values that are at or above 2.945 or at or below -2.945. null_distribution_t %&gt;% visualize(method = &quot;both&quot;, obs_stat = obs_t, direction = &quot;both&quot;) As we might have expected with this just being a standardization of the difference in means statistic that produced a small \\(p\\)-value, we also have a very small one here. 10.8.2 Conditions for t-test The infer package does not automatically check conditions for the theoretical methods to work and this warning was given when we used method = &quot;both&quot;. In order for the results of the \\(t\\)-test to be valid, three conditions must be met: Independent observations in both samples Nearly normal populations OR large sample sizes (\\(n \\ge 30\\)) Independently selected samples Condition 1: This is met since we sampled at random using R from our population. Condition 2: Recall from Figure 10.4, that we know how the populations are distributed. Both of them are close to normally distributed. If we are a little concerned about this assumption, we also do have samples of size larger than 30 (\\(n_1 = n_2 = 34\\)). Condition 3: This is met since there is no natural pairing of a movie in the Action group to a movie in the Romance group. Since all three conditions are met, we can be reasonably certain that the theory-based test will match the results of the randomization-based test using shuffling. Remember that theory-based tests can produce some incorrect results in these assumptions are not carefully checked. The only assumption for randomization and computational-based methods is that the sample is selected at random. They are our preference and we strongly believe they should be yours as well, but it’s important to also see how the theory-based tests can be done and used as an approximation for the computational techniques until at least more researchers are using these techniques that utilize the power of computers. 10.9 Conclusion We conclude by showing the infer pipeline diagram.

Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 2.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) library(infer) 11.1 Simulation-based Inference for Regression We can also use the concept of permuting to determine the standard error of our null distribution and conduct a hypothesis test for a population slope. Let’s go back to our example on teacher evaluations Chapters 6 and 7. We’ll begin in the basic regression setting to test to see if we have evidence that a statistically significant positive relationship exists between teaching and beauty scores for the University of Texas professors. As we did in Chapter 6, teaching score will act as our outcome variable and bty_avg will be our explanatory variable. We will set up this hypothesis testing process as we have each before via the “There is Only One Test” diagram in Figure 10.1 using the infer package. 11.1.1 Data Our data is stored in evals and we are focused on the measurements of the score and bty_avg variables there. Note that we don’t choose a subset of variables here since we will specify() the variables of interest using infer. evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) 11.1.2 Test statistic \\(\\delta\\) Our test statistic here is the sample slope coefficient that we denote with \\(b_1\\). 11.1.3 Observed effect \\(\\delta^*\\) We can use the specify() %&gt;% calculate() shortcut here to determine the slope value seen in our observed data: slope_obs &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) The calculated slope value from our observed sample is \\(b_1 = 0.067\\). 11.1.4 Model of \\(H_0\\) We are looking to see if a positive relationship exists so \\(H_A: \\beta_1 &gt; 0\\). Our null hypothesis is always in terms of equality so we have \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\). In other words, when we assume the null hypothesis is true, we are assuming there is NOT a linear relationship between teaching and beauty scores for University of Texas professors. 11.1.5 Simulated data Now to simulate the null hypothesis being true and recreating how our sample was created, we need to think about what it means for \\(\\beta_1\\) to be zero. If \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), we said above that there is no relationship between the teaching and beauty scores. If there is no relationship, then any one of the teaching score values could have just as likely occurred with any of the other beauty score values instead of the one that it actually did fall with. We, therefore, have another example of permuting in our simulating of data under the null hypothesis. Tactile simulation We could use a deck of 926 note cards to create a tactile simulation of this permuting process. We would write the 463 different values of beauty scores on each of the 463 cards, one per card. We would then do the same thing for the 463 teaching scores putting them on one per card. Next, we would lay out each of the 463 beauty score cards and we would shuffle the teaching score deck. Then, after shuffling the deck well, we would disperse the cards one per each one of the beauty score cards. We would then enter these new values in for teaching score and compute a sample slope based on this permuting. We could repeat this process many times, keeping track of our sample slope after each shuffle. 11.1.6 Distribution of \\(\\delta\\) under \\(H_0\\) We can build our null distribution in much the same way we did in Chapter 10 using the generate() and calculate() functions. Note also the addition of the hypothesize() function, which lets generate() know to perform the permuting instead of bootstrapping. null_slope_distn &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) null_slope_distn %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = slope_obs, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) In viewing the distribution above with shading to the right of our observed slope value of 0.067, we can see that we expect the p-value to be quite small. Let’s calculate it next using a similar syntax to what was done with visualize(). 11.1.7 The p-value null_slope_distn %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = slope_obs, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) Since 0.067 falls far to the right of this plot beyond where any of the histogram bins have data, we can say that we have a \\(p\\)-value of 0. We, thus, have evidence to reject the null hypothesis in support of there being a positive association between the beauty score and teaching score of University of Texas faculty members. Learning check (LC10.21) Repeat the inference above but this time for the correlation coefficient instead of the slope. Note the implementation of stat = &quot;correlation&quot; in the calculate() function of the infer package. 11.2 Bootstrapping for the regression slope With the p-value calculated as 0 in the hypothesis test above, we can next determine just how strong of a positive slope value we might expect between the variables of teaching score and beauty score (bty_avg) for University of Texas faculty. Recall the infer pipeline above to compute the null distribution. Recall that this assumes the null hypothesis is true that there is no relationship between teaching score and beauty score using the hypothesize() function. null_slope_distn &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ bty_avg) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) To further reinforce the process being done in the pipeline, we’ve added the type argument to generate(). This is automatically added based on the entries for specify() and hypothesize() but it provides a useful way to check to make sure generate() is created the samples in the desired way. In this case, we permuted the values of one variable across the values of the other 10,000 times and calculated a &quot;slope&quot; coefficient for each of these 10,000 generated samples. If instead we’d like to get a range of plausible values for the true slope value, we can use the process of bootstrapping: bootstrap_slope_distn %&gt;% visualize() Next we can use the get_ci() function to determine the confidence interval. Let’s do this in two different ways obtaining 99% confidence intervals. Remember that these denote a range of plausible values for an unknown true population slope parameter regressing teaching score on beauty score. percentile_slope_ci &lt;- bootstrap_slope_distn %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.99, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) percentile_slope_ci se_slope_ci &lt;- bootstrap_slope_distn %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.99, type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = slope_obs) se_slope_ci With the bootstrap distribution being close to symmetric, it makes sense that the two resulting confidence intervals are similar. 11.3 Inference for multiple regression 11.3.1 Refresher: Professor evaluations data Let’s revisit the professor evaluations data that we analyzed using multiple regression with one numerical and one categorical predictor. In particular \\(y\\): outcome variable of instructor evaluation score predictor variables \\(x_1\\): numerical explanatory/predictor variable of age \\(x_2\\): categorical explanatory/predictor variable of gender library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(moderndive) evals_multiple &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, ethnicity, gender, language, age, bty_avg, rank) First, recall that we had two competing potential models to explain professors’ teaching scores: Model 1: No interaction term. i.e. both male and female profs have the same slope describing the associated effect of age on teaching score Model 2: Includes an interaction term. i.e. we allow for male and female profs to have different slopes describing the associated effect of age on teaching score 11.3.2 Refresher: Visualizations Recall the plots we made for both these models: Figure 11.1: Model 1: no interaction effect included Figure 11.2: Model 2: interaction effect included 11.3.3 Refresher: Regression tables Last, let’s recall the regressions we fit. First, the regression with no interaction effect: note the use of + in the formula. score_model_2 &lt;- lm(score ~ age + gender, data = evals_multiple) get_regression_table(score_model_2) Table 11.1: Model 1: Regression table with no interaction effect included term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.484 0.125 35.79 0.000 4.238 4.730 age -0.009 0.003 -3.28 0.001 -0.014 -0.003 gendermale 0.191 0.052 3.63 0.000 0.087 0.294 Second, the regression with an interaction effect: note the use of * in the formula. score_model_3 &lt;- lm(score ~ age * gender, data = evals_multiple) get_regression_table(score_model_3) Table 11.2: Model 2: Regression table with interaction effect included term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.883 0.205 23.80 0.000 4.480 5.286 age -0.018 0.004 -3.92 0.000 -0.026 -0.009 gendermale -0.446 0.265 -1.68 0.094 -0.968 0.076 age:gendermale 0.014 0.006 2.45 0.015 0.003 0.024 11.3.4 Script of R code An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available here.

If you would like to contribute, please check us out on GitHub at https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book. 12.1 Effective Data Storytelling As we’ve progressed throughout this book, you’ve seen how to work with data in a variety of ways. You’ve learned effective strategies for plotting data by understanding which types of plots work best for which combinations of variable types. You’ve summarized data in table form and calculated summary statistics for a variety of different variables. Further, you’ve seen the value of inference as a process to come to conclusions about a population by using a random sample. Lastly, you’ve explored how to use linear regression and the importance of checking the conditions required to make it a valid procedure. All throughout, you’ve learned many computational techniques and focused on reproducible research in writing R code and keeping track of your work in R Markdown. All of these steps go into making a great story using data. As the textbook comes to a close, we thought it best that you explore what stellar work is being produced by data journalists throughout the world that specialize in effective data storytelling. We recommend you read and analyze this article by Walt Hickey entitled The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women. As you read over it, think carefully about how Walt is using data, graphics, and analyses to paint the picture for the reader of what the story is he wants to tell. In the spirit of reproducibility, the members of FiveThirtyEight have also shared the data that they used to create this story and some R code here. A vignette showing how to reproduce one of the plots at the end of the article using dplyr, ggplot2, and other packages in Hadley’s tidyverse is available here as part of the fivethirtyeight R package (Kim, Ismay, and Chunn 2018). Great data stories don’t mislead the reader, but rather engulf them in understanding the importance that data plays in our lives through the captivation of storytelling. 12.2 Examples Concluding remarks If you’ve come to this point in the book, I’d suspect that you know a thing or two about how to work with data in R. You’ve also gained a lot of knowledge about how to use simulation techniques to determine statistical significance and how these techniques build an intuition about traditional inferential methods like the \\(t\\)-test. The hope is that you’ve come to appreciate data wrangling, tidy datasets, and the power of data visualization. Actually, the data visualization part may be the most important thing here. If you can create truly beautiful graphics that display information in ways that the reader can clearly decipher, you’ve picked up a great skill. Let’s hope that that skill keeps you creating great stories with data into the near and far distant future. Thanks for coming along for the ride as we dove into modern data analysis using R! "],
["A-appendixA.html", "A Statistical Background A.1 Basic statistical terms", " A Statistical Background A.1 Basic statistical terms A.1.1 Mean The mean is the most commonly reported measure of center. It is commonly called the “average” though this term can be a little ambiguous. The mean is the sum of all of the data elements divided by how many elements there are. If we have \\(n\\) data points, the mean is given by: \\[Mean = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n}\\] A.1.2 Median The median is calculated by first sorting a variable’s data from smallest to largest. After sorting the data, the middle element in the list is the median. If the middle falls between two values, then the median is the mean of those two values. A.1.3 Standard deviation We will next discuss the standard deviation of a sample dataset pertaining to one variable. The formula can be a little intimidating at first but it is important to remember that it is essentially a measure of how far to expect a given data value is from its mean: \\[Standard \\, deviation = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}}\\] A.1.4 Five-number summary The five-number summary consists of five values: minimum, first quantile (25th percentile), median (50th percentile), third quantile (75th) quantile, and maximum. The quantiles are calculated as first quantile (\\(Q_1\\)): the median of the first half of the sorted data third quantile (\\(Q_3\\)): the median of the second half of the sorted data The interquartile range is defined as \\(Q_3 - Q_1\\) and is a measure of how spread out the middle 50% of values is. The five-number summary is not influenced by the presence of outliers in the ways that the mean and standard deviation are. It is, thus, recommended for skewed datasets. A.1.5 Distribution The distribution of a variable/dataset corresponds to generalizing patterns in the dataset. It often shows how frequently elements in the dataset appear. It shows how the data varies and gives some information about where a typical element in the data might fall. Distributions are most easily seen through data visualization. A.1.6 Outliers Outliers correspond to values in the dataset that fall far outside the range of “ordinary” values. In regards to a boxplot (by default), they correspond to values below \\(Q_1 - (1.5 * IQR)\\) or above \\(Q_3 + (1.5 * IQR)\\). Note that these terms (aside from Distribution) only apply to quantitative variables. "],

Figure B.1: Mind map for Inference B.2 One mean B.2.1 Problem statement The National Survey of Family Growth conducted by the Centers for Disease Control gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health. One of the variables collected on this survey is the age at first marriage. 5,534 randomly sampled US women between 2006 and 2010 completed the survey. The women sampled here had been married at least once. Do we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years? (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 4]) B.2.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is equal to 23 years. Alternative hypothesis: The mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_{0}\\), where \\(\\mu\\) represents the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 and \\(\\mu_0\\) is 23. \\(H_A: \\mu &gt; 23\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.2.3 Exploring the sample data #download.file(&quot;http://ismayc.github.io/teaching/sample_problems/ageAtMar.csv&quot;, # destfile = &quot;data/ageAtMar.csv&quot;, # method = &quot;curl&quot;) age_at_marriage &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/ageAtMar.csv&quot;) age_summ &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% summarize(sample_size = n(), mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age), minimum = min(age), lower_quartile = quantile(age, 0.25), median = median(age), upper_quartile = quantile(age, 0.75), max = max(age)) kable(age_summ) sample_size mean sd minimum lower_quartile median upper_quartile max 5534 23.4 4.72 10 20 23 26 43 The histogram below also shows the distribution of age. ggplot(data = age_at_marriage, mapping = aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, color = &quot;white&quot;) The observed statistic of interest here is the sample mean: x_bar &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) x_bar Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \\(\\mu_0 = 23\\). They seem to be quite close, but we have a large sample size here. Let’s guess that the large sample size will lead us to reject this practically small difference. B.2.4 Non-traditional methods Bootstrapping for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \\(\\mu_0 = 23\\), we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 5534 was selected. We can use the idea of bootstrapping to simulate the population from which the sample came and then generate samples from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. Recall how bootstrapping would apply in this context: Sample with replacement from our original sample of 5534 women and repeat this process 10,000 times, calculate the mean for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1., combine all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a boot_distn object, and shift the center of this distribution over to the null value of 23. (This is needed since it will be centered at 23.44 via the process of bootstrapping.) set.seed(2018) null_distn_one_mean &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, mu = 23) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a right-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to 23.44 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_one_mean %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = &quot;greater&quot;) pvalue So our \\(p\\)-value is and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu\\) using our sample data using bootstrapping. Note that we don’t need to shift this distribution since we want the center of our confidence interval to be our point estimate \\(\\bar{x}_{obs} = &lt;div data-pagedtable=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;script data-pagedtable-source type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; {&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:[&quot;stat&quot;],&quot;name&quot;:[1],&quot;type&quot;:[&quot;dbl&quot;],&quot;align&quot;:[&quot;right&quot;]}],&quot;data&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:&quot;23.4&quot;}],&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;columns&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:{},&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;rows&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:[10],&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;pages&quot;:{}}} &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\). boot_distn_one_mean &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% specify(response = age) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) ci &lt;- boot_distn_one_mean %&gt;% get_ci() ci boot_distn_one_mean %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 23 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu\\) (the unknown population mean) and the entire interval is larger than 23. This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (\\(\\mu &gt; 23\\)). Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is between 23.316 and 23.565. B.2.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are collected independently. The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The distribution of the response variable should be normal or the sample size should be at least 30. The histogram for the sample above does show some skew. The Q-Q plot below also shows some skew. ggplot(data = age_at_marriage, mapping = aes(sample = age)) + stat_qq() The sample size here is quite large though (\\(n = 5534\\)) so both conditions are met. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean \\(\\mu\\). A good guess is the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}_{obs} = &lt;div data-pagedtable=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;script data-pagedtable-source type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; {&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:[&quot;stat&quot;],&quot;name&quot;:[1],&quot;type&quot;:[&quot;dbl&quot;],&quot;align&quot;:[&quot;right&quot;]}],&quot;data&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:&quot;23.4&quot;}],&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;columns&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:{},&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;rows&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:[10],&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;pages&quot;:{}}} &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\) or larger assuming that the population mean is 23 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can “standardize” this original test statistic of \\(\\bar{X}\\) into a \\(T\\) statistic that follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 1\\): \\[ T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{ S / \\sqrt{n} } \\sim t (df = n - 1) \\] where \\(S\\) represents the standard deviation of the sample and \\(n\\) is the sample size. Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the t_test() function to perform this analysis for us. t_test_results &lt;- age_at_marriage %&gt;% infer::t_test(formula = age ~ NULL, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, mu = 23) t_test_results We see here that the \\(t_{obs}\\) value is 6.936. Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(t_{obs}\\) value of 6.936 or more in our null distribution of a \\(t\\) with 5533 degrees of freedom—is essentially 0. State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean was statistically greater than the hypothesized mean has supporting evidence here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years. Confidence interval t.test(x = age_at_marriage$age, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, mu = 23)$conf [1] 23.3 23.6 attr(,&quot;conf.level&quot;) [1] 0.95 B.2.6 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met (the large sample size was the driver here) leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.3 One proportion B.3.1 Problem statement The CEO of a large electric utility claims that 80 percent of his 1,000,000 customers are satisfied with the service they receive. To test this claim, the local newspaper surveyed 100 customers, using simple random sampling. 73 were satisfied and the remaining were unsatisfied. Based on these findings from the sample, can we reject the CEO’s hypothesis that 80% of the customers are satisfied? [Tweaked a bit from http://stattrek.com/hypothesis-test/proportion.aspx?Tutorial=AP] B.3.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is equal 0.80. Alternative hypothesis: The proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is different from 0.80. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\pi = p_{0}\\), where \\(\\pi\\) represents the proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive and \\(p_0\\) is 0.8. \\(H_A: \\pi \\ne 0.8\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.3.3 Exploring the sample data elec &lt;- c(rep(&quot;satisfied&quot;, 73), rep(&quot;unsatisfied&quot;, 27)) %&gt;% as_data_frame() %&gt;% rename(satisfy = value) The bar graph below also shows the distribution of satisfy. ggplot(data = elec, aes(x = satisfy)) + geom_bar() The observed statistic is computed as p_hat &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) p_hat Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the sample proportion of 0.73 is statistically different from \\(p_0 = 0.8\\) based on this sample. They seem to be quite close, and our sample size is not huge here (\\(n = 100\\)). Let’s guess that we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis. B.3.4 Non-traditional methods Simulation for hypothesis test In order to look to see if 0.73 is statistically different from 0.8, we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 100 was selected. We can use the idea of an unfair coin to simulate this process. We will simulate flipping an unfair coin (with probability of success 0.8 matching the null hypothesis) 100 times. Then we will keep track of how many heads come up in those 100 flips. Our simulated statistic matches with how we calculated the original statistic \\(\\hat{p}\\): the number of heads (satisfied) out of our total sample of 100. We then repeat this process many times (say 10,000) to create the null distribution looking at the simulated proportions of successes: set.seed(2018) null_distn_one_prop &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, p = 0.8) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are 0.8 - 0.73 = 0.07 away from 0.8 in BOTH directions for our \\(p\\)-value: null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_one_prop %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = p_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue So our \\(p\\)-value is and we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\pi\\) using our sample data. To do so, we use bootstrapping, which involves sampling with replacement from our original sample of 100 survey respondents and repeating this process 10,000 times, calculating the proportion of successes for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1., combining all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a boot_distn object, identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of this distribution (corresponding to the 5% significance level chosen) to find a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\pi\\), and interpret this confidence interval in the context of the problem. boot_distn_one_prop &lt;- elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) Just as we use the mean function for calculating the mean over a numerical variable, we can also use it to compute the proportion of successes for a categorical variable where we specify what we are calling a “success” after the ==. (Think about the formula for calculating a mean and how R handles logical statements such as satisfy == &quot;satisfied&quot; for why this must be true.) ci &lt;- boot_distn_one_prop %&gt;% get_ci() ci boot_distn_one_prop %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0.80 is contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\pi\\) (the unknown population proportion). This matches with our hypothesis test results of failing to reject the null hypothesis. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true proportion of customers who are satisfied with the service they receive is between 0.64 and 0.81. B.3.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are collected independently. The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The number of expected successes and expected failures is at least 10. This condition is met since 73 and 27 are both greater than 10. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population proportion \\(\\pi\\). A good guess is the sample proportion \\(\\hat{P}\\). Recall that this sample proportion is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample proportion of \\(\\hat{p}_{obs} = &lt;div data-pagedtable=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;script data-pagedtable-source type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; {&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:[&quot;stat&quot;],&quot;name&quot;:[1],&quot;type&quot;:[&quot;dbl&quot;],&quot;align&quot;:[&quot;right&quot;]}],&quot;data&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:&quot;0.73&quot;}],&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;columns&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:{},&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;rows&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:[10],&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;pages&quot;:{}}} &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\) or larger assuming that the population proportion is 0.80 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can standardize this original test statistic of \\(\\hat{P}\\) into a \\(Z\\) statistic that follows a \\(N(0, 1)\\) distribution. \\[ Z =\\dfrac{ \\hat{P} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n} }} \\sim N(0, 1) \\] Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand” by plugging the observed values into the formula, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. The calculation has been done in R below for completeness though: p_hat &lt;- 0.73 p0 &lt;- 0.8 n &lt;- 100 (z_obs &lt;- (p_hat - p0) / sqrt( (p0 * (1 - p0)) / n)) [1] -1.75 We see here that the \\(z_{obs}\\) value is around -1.75. Our observed sample proportion of 0.73 is 1.75 standard errors below the hypothesized parameter value of 0.8. Visualize and compute \\(p\\)-value elec %&gt;% specify(response = satisfy, success = &quot;satisfied&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, p = 0.8) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;z&quot;) %&gt;% visualize(method = &quot;theoretical&quot;, obs_stat = z_obs, direction = &quot;both&quot;) 2 * pnorm(z_obs) [1] 0.0801 The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(z_{obs}\\) value of -1.75 or more extreme (in both directions) in our null distribution—is around 8%. Note that we could also do this test directly using the prop.test function. stats::prop.test(x = table(elec$satisfy), n = length(elec$satisfy), alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, p = 0.8, correct = FALSE) 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction data: table(elec$satisfy), null probability 0.8 X-squared = 3, df = 1, p-value = 0.08 alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.8 95 percent confidence interval: 0.636 0.807 sample estimates: p 0.73 prop.test does a \\(\\chi^2\\) test here but this matches up exactly with what we would expect: \\(x^2_{obs} = 3.06 = (-1.75)^2 = (z_{obs})^2\\) and the \\(p\\)-values are the same because we are focusing on a two-tailed test. Note that the 95 percent confidence interval given above matches well with the one calculated using bootstrapping. State conclusion We, therefore, do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample proportion was not statistically greater than the hypothesized proportion has not been invalidated. Based on this sample, we have do not evidence that the proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is different from 0.80, at the 5% level. B.3.6 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.4 Two proportions B.4.1 Problem statement A 2010 survey asked 827 randomly sampled registered voters in California “Do you support? Or do you oppose? Drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California? Or do you not know enough to say?” Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the data provide strong evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do not have an opinion on this issue is different than that of non-college graduates. (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 6]) B.4.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: There is no association between having an opinion on drilling and having a college degree for all registered California voters in 2010. Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between having an opinion on drilling and having a college degree for all registered California voters in 2010. Another way in words Null hypothesis: The probability that a Californian voter in 2010 having no opinion on drilling and is a college graduate is the same as that of a non-college graduate. Alternative hypothesis: These parameter probabilities are different. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\pi_{college} = \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) or \\(H_0: \\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college} = 0\\), where \\(\\pi\\) represents the probability of not having an opinion on drilling. \\(H_A: \\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college} \\ne 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.4.3 Exploring the sample data #download.file(&quot;http://ismayc.github.io/teaching/sample_problems/offshore.csv&quot;, # destfile = &quot;data/offshore.csv&quot;, # method = &quot;curl&quot;) offshore &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/offshore.csv&quot;) offshore %&gt;% tabyl(college_grad, response) off_summ &lt;- offshore %&gt;% group_by(college_grad) %&gt;% summarize(prop_no_opinion = mean(response == &quot;no opinion&quot;), sample_size = n()) ggplot(offshore, aes(x = college_grad, fill = response)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;) + coord_flip() Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if a difference exists in the size of the bars corresponding to no opinion for the plot. Based solely on the plot, we have little reason to believe that a difference exists since the bars seem to be about the same size, BUT…it’s important to use statistics to see if that difference is actually statistically significant! B.4.4 Non-traditional methods Collecting summary info The observed statistic is d_hat &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) d_hat Randomization for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample proportion of no opinion for college graduates of 0.337 is statistically different than that for graduates of 0.237, we need to account for the sample sizes. Note that this is the same as looking to see if \\(\\hat{p}_{grad} - \\hat{p}_{nograd}\\) is statistically different than 0. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 389 and 438 were selected. We can use the idea of randomization testing (also known as permutation testing) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using shuffling from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. set.seed(2018) null_distn_two_props &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) null_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to -0.099 or less than or equal to 0.099 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;two_sided&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_two_props %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;two_sided&quot;) pvalue So our \\(p\\)-value is and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the tails of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) using our sample data with bootstrapping. boot_distn_two_props &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) ci &lt;- boot_distn_two_props %&gt;% get_ci() ci boot_distn_two_props %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\pi_{college} - \\pi_{no\\_college}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter, we have evidence that the proportion of college graduates in California with no opinion on drilling is different than that of non-college graduates. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true proportion of non-college graduates with no opinion on offshore drilling in California is between 0.16 dollars smaller to 0.04 dollars smaller than for college graduates. B.4.5 Traditional methods B.4.6 Check conditions Remember that in order to use the short-cut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: Each case that was selected must be independent of all the other cases selected. This condition is met since cases were selected at random to observe. Sample size: The number of pooled successes and pooled failures must be at least 10 for each group. We need to first figure out the pooled success rate: \\[\\hat{p}_{obs} = \\dfrac{131 + 104}{827} = 0.28.\\] We now determine expected (pooled) success and failure counts: \\(0.28 \\cdot (131 + 258) = 108.92\\), \\(0.72 \\cdot (131 + 258) = 280.08\\) \\(0.28 \\cdot (104 + 334) = 122.64\\), \\(0.72 \\cdot (104 + 334) = 315.36\\) Independent selection of samples: The cases are not paired in any meaningful way. We have no reason to suspect that a college graduate selected would have any relationship to a non-college graduate selected. B.4.7 Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we are interested in seeing if our observed difference in sample proportions corresponding to no opinion on drilling (\\(\\hat{p}_{college, obs} - \\hat{p}_{no\\_college, obs}\\) = 0.033) is statistically different than 0. Assuming that conditions are met and the null hypothesis is true, we can use the standard normal distribution to standardize the difference in sample proportions (\\(\\hat{P}_{college} - \\hat{P}_{no\\_college}\\)) using the standard error of \\(\\hat{P}_{college} - \\hat{P}_{no\\_college}\\) and the pooled estimate: \\[ Z =\\dfrac{ (\\hat{P}_1 - \\hat{P}_2) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\hat{P}(1 - \\hat{P})}{n_1} + \\dfrac{\\hat{P}(1 - \\hat{P})}{n_2} }} \\sim N(0, 1) \\] where \\(\\hat{P} = \\dfrac{\\text{total number of successes} }{ \\text{total number of cases}}.\\) Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the prop.test function to perform this analysis for us. z_hat &lt;- offshore %&gt;% specify(response ~ college_grad, success = &quot;no opinion&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;z&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) z_hat The observed difference in sample proportions is 3.16 standard deviations smaller than 0. The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing a \\(Z\\) value of -3.16 or more extreme in our null distribution—is 0.0016. This can also be calculated in R directly: 2 * pnorm(-3.16, lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.00158 B.4.8 State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that a statistically significant difference did not exist in the proportions of no opinion on offshore drilling between college educated and non-college educated Californians was not validated. We do have evidence to suggest that there is a dependency between college graduation and position on offshore drilling for Californians. B.4.9 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results. B.5 Two means (independent samples) B.5.1 Problem statement Average income varies from one region of the country to another, and it often reflects both lifestyles and regional living expenses. Suppose a new graduate is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and he wants to see whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other. He would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on two randomly selected samples from the 2000 Census. (Tweaked a bit from Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014 [Chapter 5]) B.5.2 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: There is no association between income and location (Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA). Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between income and location (Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA). Another way in words Null hypothesis: The mean income is the same for both cities. Alternative hypothesis: The mean income is different for the two cities. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu_{sac} = \\mu_{cle}\\) or \\(H_0: \\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle} = 0\\), where \\(\\mu\\) represents the average income. \\(H_A: \\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle} \\ne 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.5.3 Exploring the sample data inc_summ &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% group_by(metro_area) %&gt;% summarize(sample_size = n(), mean = mean(income), sd = sd(income), minimum = min(income), lower_quartile = quantile(income, 0.25), median = median(income), upper_quartile = quantile(income, 0.75), max = max(income)) kable(inc_summ) metro_area sample_size mean sd minimum lower_quartile median upper_quartile max Cleveland_ OH 212 27467 27681 0 8475 21000 35275 152400 Sacramento_ CA 175 32428 35774 0 8050 20000 49350 206900 The boxplot below also shows the mean for each group highlighted by the red dots. ggplot(cle_sac, aes(x = metro_area, y = income)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun.y = &quot;mean&quot;, geom = &quot;point&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;) Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if a difference exists in the mean income of the two levels of the explanatory variable. Based solely on the boxplot, we have reason to believe that no difference exists. The distributions of income seem similar and the means fall in roughly the same place. B.5.4 Non-traditional methods Collecting summary info We now compute the observed statistic: d_hat &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;)) d_hat Randomization for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean for Sacramento of 27467.066 is statistically different than that for Cleveland of 32427.543, we need to account for the sample sizes. Note that this is the same as looking to see if \\(\\bar{x}_{sac} - \\bar{x}_{cle}\\) is statistically different than 0. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 212 and 175 were selected. We can use the idea of randomization testing (also known as permutation testing) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using shuffling from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. set.seed(2018) null_distn_two_means &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;)) null_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a two-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to or less than or equal to for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_two_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;both&quot;) pvalue So our \\(p\\)-value is and we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are not very far into the tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle}\\) using our sample data with bootstrapping. Here we will bootstrap each of the groups with replacement instead of shuffling. This is done using the groups argument in the resample function to fix the size of each group to be the same as the original group sizes of 175 for Sacramento and 212 for Cleveland. boot_distn_two_means &lt;- cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;, &quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;)) ci &lt;- boot_distn_two_means %&gt;% get_ci() ci boot_distn_two_means %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0 is contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu_{sac} - \\mu_{cle}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of failing to reject the null hypothesis. Since zero is a plausible value of the population parameter, we do not have evidence that Sacramento incomes are different than Cleveland incomes. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean yearly income for those living in Sacramento is between 1445.53 dollars smaller to 11307.82 dollars higher than for Cleveland. Note: You could also use the null distribution based on randomization with a shift to have its center at \\(\\bar{x}_{sac} - \\bar{x}_{cle} = \\$&lt;div data-pagedtable=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;script data-pagedtable-source type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt; {&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:[&quot;stat&quot;],&quot;name&quot;:[1],&quot;type&quot;:[&quot;dbl&quot;],&quot;align&quot;:[&quot;right&quot;]}],&quot;data&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:&quot;4960&quot;}],&quot;options&quot;:{&quot;columns&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:{},&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;rows&quot;:{&quot;min&quot;:[10],&quot;max&quot;:[10]},&quot;pages&quot;:{}}} &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\) instead of at 0 and calculate its percentiles. The confidence interval produced via this method should be comparable to the one done using bootstrapping above. B.5.5 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the short-cut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations are independent in both groups. This metro_area variable is met since the cases are randomly selected from each city. Approximately normal: The distribution of the response for each group should be normal or the sample sizes should be at least 30. ggplot(cle_sac, aes(x = income)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, binwidth = 20000) + facet_wrap(~ metro_area) We have some reason to doubt the normality assumption here since both the histograms show deviation from a normal model fitting the data well for each group. The sample sizes for each group are greater than 100 though so the assumptions should still apply. Independent samples: The samples should be collected without any natural pairing. There is no mention of there being a relationship between those selected in Cleveland and in Sacramento. B.5.6 Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we are interested in seeing if our observed difference in sample means (\\(\\bar{x}_{sac, obs} - \\bar{x}_{cle, obs}\\) = 4960.477) is statistically different than 0. Assuming that conditions are met and the null hypothesis is true, we can use the \\(t\\) distribution to standardize the difference in sample means (\\(\\bar{X}_{sac} - \\bar{X}_{cle}\\)) using the approximate standard error of \\(\\bar{X}_{sac} - \\bar{X}_{cle}\\) (invoking \\(S_{sac}\\) and \\(S_{cle}\\) as estimates of unknown \\(\\sigma_{sac}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{cle}\\)). \\[ T =\\dfrac{ (\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - 0}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{S_1^2}{n_1} + \\dfrac{S_2^2}{n_2}} } \\sim t (df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1)) \\] where 1 = Sacramento and 2 = Cleveland with \\(S_1^2\\) and \\(S_2^2\\) the sample variance of the incomes of both cities, respectively, and \\(n_1 = 175\\) for Sacramento and \\(n_2 = 212\\) for Cleveland. Observed test statistic Note that we could also do (ALMOST) this test directly using the t.test function. The x and y arguments are expected to both be numeric vectors here so we’ll need to appropriately filter our datasets. cle_sac %&gt;% specify(income ~ metro_area) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;t&quot;, order = c(&quot;Cleveland_ OH&quot;, &quot;Sacramento_ CA&quot;)) We see here that the observed test statistic value is around -1.5. While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. B.5.7 Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing an \\(t_{174}\\) value of -1.501 or more extreme (in both directions) in our null distribution—is 0.13. This can also be calculated in R directly: 2 * pt(-1.501, df = min(212 - 1, 175 - 1), lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.135 We can also approximate by using the standard normal curve: 2 * pnorm(-1.501) [1] 0.133 Note that the 95 percent confidence interval given above matches well with the one calculated using bootstrapping. B.5.8 State conclusion We, therefore, do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that a statistically significant difference not existing in the means was backed by this statistical analysis. We do not have evidence to suggest that the true mean income differs between Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA based on this data. B.5.9 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results. B.6 Two means (paired samples) Problem statement Trace metals in drinking water affect the flavor and an unusually high concentration can pose a health hazard. Ten pairs of data were taken measuring zinc concentration in bottom water and surface water at 10 randomly selected locations on a stretch of river. Do the data suggest that the true average concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of bottom water? (Note that units are not given.) [Tweaked a bit from https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat500/node/51] B.6.1 Competing hypotheses In words Null hypothesis: The mean concentration in the bottom water is the same as that of the surface water at different paired locations. Alternative hypothesis: The mean concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of the bottom water at different paired locations. In symbols (with annotations) \\(H_0: \\mu_{diff} = 0\\), where \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) represents the mean difference in concentration for surface water minus bottom water. \\(H_A: \\mu_{diff} &lt; 0\\) Set \\(\\alpha\\) It’s important to set the significance level before starting the testing using the data. Let’s set the significance level at 5% here. B.6.2 Exploring the sample data #download.file(&quot;http://ismayc.github.io/teaching/sample_problems/zinc_tidy.csv&quot;, # destfile = &quot;data/zinc_tidy.csv&quot;, # method = &quot;curl&quot;) zinc_tidy &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/zinc_tidy.csv&quot;) We want to look at the differences in surface - bottom for each location: zinc_diff &lt;- zinc_tidy %&gt;% group_by(loc_id) %&gt;% summarize(pair_diff = diff(concentration)) %&gt;% ungroup() Next we calculate the mean difference as our observed statistic: d_hat &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) d_hat The histogram below also shows the distribution of pair_diff. ggplot(zinc_diff, aes(x = pair_diff)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, color = &quot;white&quot;) Guess about statistical significance We are looking to see if the sample paired mean difference of is statistically less than 0. They seem to be quite close, but we have a small number of pairs here. Let’s guess that we will fail to reject the null hypothesis. B.6.3 Non-traditional methods Bootstrapping for hypothesis test In order to look to see if the observed sample mean difference \\(\\bar{x}_{diff} = 4960.477\\) is statistically less than 0, we need to account for the number of pairs. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the paired data was selected in a way similar to how we calculated our original difference in sample means. Treating the differences as our data of interest, we next use the process of bootstrapping to build other simulated samples and then calculate the mean of the bootstrap samples. We hypothesize that the mean difference is zero. This process is similar to comparing the One Mean example seen above, but using the differences between the two groups as a single sample with a hypothesized mean difference of 0. set.seed(2018) null_distn_paired_means &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, mu = 0) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize() We can next use this distribution to observe our \\(p\\)-value. Recall this is a left-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are less than or equal to 4960.477 for our \\(p\\)-value. null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;less&quot;) Calculate \\(p\\)-value pvalue &lt;- null_distn_paired_means %&gt;% get_pvalue(obs_stat = d_hat, direction = &quot;less&quot;) pvalue So our \\(p\\)-value is essentially and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the left tail of the null distribution. Bootstrapping for confidence interval We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) using our sample data (the calculated differences) with bootstrapping. This is similar to the bootstrapping done in a one sample mean case, except now our data is differences instead of raw numerical data. Note that this code is identical to the pipeline shown in the hypothesis test above except the hypothesize() function is not called. boot_distn_paired_means &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% specify(response = pair_diff) %&gt;% generate(reps = 10000) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) ci &lt;- boot_distn_paired_means %&gt;% get_ci() ci boot_distn_paired_means %&gt;% visualize(endpoints = ci, direction = &quot;between&quot;) We see that 0 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter and since the entire confidence interval falls below zero, we have evidence that surface zinc concentration levels are lower, on average, than bottom level zinc concentrations. Interpretation: We are 95% confident the true mean zinc concentration on the surface is between 0.11 units smaller to 0.05 units smaller than on the bottom. B.6.4 Traditional methods Check conditions Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met. Independent observations: The observations among pairs are independent. The locations are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met. Approximately normal: The distribution of population of differences is normal or the number of pairs is at least 30. The histogram above does show some skew so we have reason to doubt the population being normal based on this sample. We also only have 10 pairs which is fewer than the 30 needed. A theory-based test may not be valid here. Test statistic The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean difference \\(\\mu_{diff}\\). A good guess is the sample mean difference \\(\\bar{X}_{diff}\\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff, obs} = 0.0804\\) or larger assuming that the population mean difference is 0 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, we can “standardize” this original test statistic of \\(\\bar{X}_{diff}\\) into a \\(T\\) statistic that follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 1\\): \\[ T =\\dfrac{ \\bar{X}_{diff} - 0}{ S_{diff} / \\sqrt{n} } \\sim t (df = n - 1) \\] where \\(S\\) represents the standard deviation of the sample differences and \\(n\\) is the number of pairs. Observed test statistic While one could compute this observed test statistic by “hand”, the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the t_test function on the differences to perform this analysis for us. t_test_results &lt;- zinc_diff %&gt;% infer::t_test(formula = pair_diff ~ NULL, alternative = &quot;less&quot;, mu = 0) t_test_results We see here that the \\(t_{obs}\\) value is -4.864. Compute \\(p\\)-value The \\(p\\)-value—the probability of observing a \\(t_{obs}\\) value of -4.864 or less in our null distribution of a \\(t\\) with 9 degrees of freedom—is 0. This can also be calculated in R directly: pt(-4.8638, df = nrow(zinc_diff) - 1, lower.tail = TRUE) [1] 0.000446 State conclusion We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean difference was not statistically less than the hypothesized mean of 0 has been invalidated here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean concentration in the bottom water is greater than that of the surface water at different paired locations. B.6.5 Comparing results Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \\(p\\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results here. "],

This allows the reader to more easily compare the ordering of different airlines in terms of departed flights (Robbins 2013). We can also much more easily answer questions like “How many airlines have more departing flights than Southwest Airlines?”. We can use the sorted table giving the number of flights defined as sorted_flights to reorder the carrier. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() + scale_x_discrete(limits = names(sorted_flights)) Figure C.1: Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline - Descending numbers The last addition here specifies the values of the horizontal x axis on a discrete scale to correspond to those given by the entries of sorted_flights. C.2 Interactive graphics C.2.1 Interactive linegraphs Another useful tool for viewing linegraphs such as this is the dygraph function in the dygraphs package in combination with the dyRangeSelector function. This allows us to zoom in on a selected range and get an interactive plot for us to work with: library(dygraphs) flights_day &lt;- mutate(flights, date = as.Date(time_hour)) flights_summarized &lt;- flights_day %&gt;% group_by(date) %&gt;% summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) rownames(flights_summarized) &lt;- flights_summarized$date flights_summarized &lt;- select(flights_summarized, -date) dyRangeSelector(dygraph(flights_summarized)) The syntax here is a little different than what we have covered so far. The dygraph function is expecting for the dates to be given as the rownames of the object. We then remove the date variable from the flights_summarized data frame since it is accounted for in the rownames. Lastly, we run the dygraph function on the new data frame that only contains the median arrival delay as a column and then provide the ability to have a selector to zoom in on the interactive plot via dyRangeSelector. (Note that this plot will only be interactive in the HTML version of this book.) "],
