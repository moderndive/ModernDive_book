# ModernDive 1.1.0

* Typo fixes and clarifying wording tweaks
* With a big assist from @mariumtapal, we cleaned and refactored all R Markdown code to make it easier for future bookdown users to understand. However all code seen by readers of the print edition has been left intact.
* Appendix C (online only):
    + Renamed from "Reach for the Stars" to "Tips and Tricks". 
    + Added C.1 section on most common data wrangling questions we've encountered, mostly written by @smetzer180

# ModernDive 1.0.0

* Version 1.0.0 corresponds to our [CRC Press print edition](https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Inference-via-Data-Science-A-ModernDive-into-R-and-the-Tidyverse/Ismay-Kim/p/book/9780367409821).
* Changed word in title of book from "moderndive" to "ModernDive" for consistency with hex sticker.
* Added Foreword by Kelly S. McConville. Thanks, @mcconvil!
* Fixed various typos throughout the book and tried to make language consistent. For example, using "data sets" instead of "datasets" or "data-sets".
* Switched from `gather()` and `spread()` with `tidyr` to `pivot_long()` and `pivot_wide()` following [this tidyverse article](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html)
* Added `geom_parallel_slopes()` user-defined geom extension to `ggplot2`


***


# ModernDive 0.6.1

* Changed chapter numbers. Chapter "1. Introduction" is now "Preface", thus all Chapter numbers decreased by one.
* Moved discussions on normal distribution (Ch on sampling) and log-transformations (Ch on tell your data story) to Appendix A "Statistical Background"
* Updated images used in book
* Did a full scan of the book for typos
* Created greyscale versions of many images for the CRC Press printed version

# ModernDive 0.6.0

We're only a few cosmetic edits away from v1.0.0, which will correspond to our print edition with CRC Press!


## Done first pass of infer chapters

Completed major re-organization and clean-up of Chapters 9-11 using the `infer` package for "tidy and transparent" statistcal inference.

* Chapter 9: Bootstrapping & confidence intervals
    + Tactile exercise of sampling 50 pennies from bank and resampling from this sample.
    + Added sections on
        1. "Interpreting confidence intervals", in particular determinants of CI width.
        1. "Theory-based confidence intervals" using formula for SE of p-hat, thereby bridging gap between simulation and theory-based methods.
* Chapter 10: Hypothesis testing
    + Added `promotions` example on gender discrimination in promotions at a bank. Data source: `openintro::gender.discrimination`
    + Added section on "Theory-based hypothesis tests" using t-test, thereby bridging gap between simulation and theory-based methods.
* Chapter 11: Inference for regression.
    + Discussion on LINE conditions for inference. In particular using `moderndive::get_regression_points()` wrapper function to `broom::augment()` so that novices can do their own residual analyses.

## Other changes

* Chapter 7: Multiple regression
    + Added Section 7.3.1 on model selection: choosing between "interaction" and "parallel slopes" models
* Chapter 8: Sampling
    + Added Section 8.5.3 with more in-depth discussion of normal distribution
* Chapter 12: Renamed to "Tell your story with data"

1. Speaking of DataCamp, we point readers to [various DataCamp courses](https://moderndive.netlify.com/index.html#datacamp) that directly align with various chapters in the book!
1. We significantly cleaned up Chapter 8 on sampling! In particular: adding a [2013 Obama approval rating poll](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/04/248793753/poll-support-for-obama-among-young-americans-eroding) example to tie in with our sampling bowl tactile and virtual simulations and making it very clear that ultimately we are performing statistical **inference via sampling**.

* Chapter 8 - Sampling:
    + Significantly cleaned up sampling terminology and definitions and made more clear that we are **sampling for inference**
    + Cleaned up section and subsection structure to be much cleaner:
        1. Tactile sampling simulation
        1. Virtual sampling simulation
        1. In real-life sampling: Introduced example of 2013 Obama approval rating poll and then tie everything with [sampling bowl](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book/blob/master/images/sampling_bowl.jpeg).
