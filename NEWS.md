# ModernDive 0.4.0.9000



# ModernDive 0.4.0

## Highlights

1. The [`infer` package](http://infer.netlify.com/) is ready for prime-time! Thus we made a first pass at incorporating it into the book in Chapters 9 and 10 on confidence intervals and hypothesis testing!
1. Chapter 12 on "Thinking with Data" now includes a case study using the [Seattle house prices](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) dataset on Kaggle.com. Chapters 3 and 4 from new ["Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/modeling-with-data-in-the-tidyverse) DataCamp course by Albert Y. Kim are based on this analysis!
1. Speaking of DataCamp, we point readers to [various DataCamp courses](https://moderndive.netlify.com/index.html#datacamp) that directly align with various chapters in the book!
1. We significantly cleaned up Chapter 8 on sampling! In particular: adding a [2013 Obama approval rating poll](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/04/248793753/poll-support-for-obama-among-young-americans-eroding) example to tie in with our sampling bowl tactile and virtual simulations and making it very clear that ultimately we are performing statistical **inference via sampling**.
